  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='large'>SENTENCE OF THE COURT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Guilty!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deep, sonorous voice of the foreman of the jury
sounded out upon the solemn stillness of the crowded court-room
like the knell of doom.</p>

<p class='c007'>And doom it was, and to one who never consciously committed
a mean act in all his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect which that one word produced was marked.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a rustle of excitement and disapproval among
the crowd, while deep-drawn sighs and expressions of
sorrow showed that sympathy was strong for the prisoner
at the bar, who for the last hour, while the jury was absent
to decide upon the verdict, had sat with bent head and
listless attitude, as if wearied out with the bitter trial to
which he had been subjected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, however, as he had been commanded “to look upon
the jury,” his head was proudly lifted, revealing an exceedingly
intelligent and handsome face, and a pair of fine dark
eyes met those of the foreman unflinchingly while the least
smile of scorn and bitterness disturbed the firm, strong
mouth, showing that he had believed he had not much to
hope for from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the word was spoken which sealed his fate, a gray
pallor settled over his face, and he dropped into his former
attitude; otherwise he betrayed no sign of emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then something occurred which very seldom occurs in
a crowded court-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>A low cry of pain not far from the prisoner made every
eye turn that way, and made him shiver as with a sudden
chill.</p>

<p class='c007'>A tender, sorrowful gleam crept into his dark eyes, the
proud lips unbent and trembled slightly, and a heavy sigh
heaved his broad chest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next moment a slender, girlish form started up from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>her seat, and a fair, flushed face was turned with eloquent
pleading toward the grave judge, sitting like a statue in his
chair of state, while an earnest, quivering voice rang out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, sir, he is <em>not guilty</em>—I know that Earle Wayne
<em>never was</em> guilty of such a deed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A touching picture, and very sweet and attractive withal,
Editha Dalton made, standing there so unconscious of
herself, or that <em>she</em> was guilty of any breach of decorum;
her fair hair floating like gleams of sunlight upon her
graceful shoulders, her sweet face flushed and full of pain,
her deep blue eyes filled with tears and raised beseechingly
to the judge, her delicate hands clasped imploringly and half-outstretched
toward him, as if seeking for mercy in the
sentence he was about to pronounce.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man’s face lost its habitual sternness for a
moment, and his own eyes softened almost to tenderness,
as he caught the sweet tones, and turned to look upon her,
so beautiful in her appealing attitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not often that a culprit found one so earnest and
beautiful to plead his cause. The able lawyer who had
had charge of the case for the young man, with all his
eloquence, had not moved him as did this fair maiden,
with her flushed, pained face, her pleading eyes, her outstretched
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>A murmur of sympathy sounded again throughout the
room, and a wave of regret swept over the judge’s heart as
he turned from the girl to the prisoner, feeling himself
more than half convinced of the truth of her words, as he
marked again the noble face and the honest expression of
the clear, unflinching eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>But some one pulled Editha Dalton hastily back into the
chair from which she had arisen, and a stern voice uttered
in her ear:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Edie! Edie! sit down, child! What <em>are</em> you thinking
of, when your own evidence did more toward convicting him
than that of any one else?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! I know it! I know it! but he is <em>not guilty</em> all the
same. It is only the cruel force of circumstances that makes
him appear so!” she sobbed, wildly, burying her face, with
a gesture of despair, in her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge’s keen ears caught the words, and his sharp
eyes wandered again from her to the prisoner, a shade of
uneasiness in their glance. He marked the pallor that had
overspread his face, making him almost ghastly; the yearning,
troubled look in the eyes now fixed so sadly upon the
weeping girl; the firmly compressed lips and clenched hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>which told of a mighty effort at self-control and something
whispered within him that the jury was at fault—that the
evidence, though so clear and conclusive, was at fault and,
since there could be no reprieve, to make the sentence as
light as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Prisoner at the bar, stand up,” he said, and Earle Wayne
instant arose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tall, manly, and with conscious dignity, he confronted
the judge to receive his sentence, his eye never faltering,
his face calm and proud, though still exceedingly pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have heard the verdict of the jury—have you anything
to say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing, save what I have already said, your honor.
<em>I am not guilty of the crime with which I am charged, and
if I live I will yet prove it!</em>”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was all; but the firm, unfaltering words seemed to
carry conviction with them, and even the jury began to look
grave and troubled, as if they, too, feared they had convicted
an innocent man.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the fiat had gone forth, and the judge, anxious to
have the uncomfortable matter disposed of, pronounced the
lightest sentence possible—“three years’ hard labor in the
State prison at ——.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A mighty sigh burst from the multitude, as if it had
come from a single breast, as he ceased, and then a hush
like death pervaded the room. It was the best the judge
could do, and the very least they could expect; but it was
sad to see a promising young man of twenty condemned to
penal servitude for a term of years, be it ever so few.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prisoner received it with the same calmness that had
characterized him throughout the trial, only a slight quivering
of the eyelids showing that he had heeded the words
at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment of utter silence pervaded the room after the
sentence was pronounced, the court was dismissed, and then
the curious but sympathetic rabble went its way.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, with winged feet, a slight form darted forward from
the crowd, and, almost before he was aware of her presence,
Editha Dalton was beside the prisoner, her pained, quivering
face upraised to his.</p>

<p class='c007'>She seized his hand in both of hers, she laid her hot,
flushed cheek upon it, and sobbed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Earle, forgive me! forgive me! but I <em>had</em> to tell the
truth, and it has ruined you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, Edie—Miss Dalton. You have done perfectly
right, and I have nothing to forgive.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The young man spoke kindly, soothingly, but a sudden
flush mounted to his brow, and the hot cheek against his
hand thrilled him with a bitter pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it was my evidence that told most against you. I
tried not to tell it all; but, oh! they made me, with their
cruel questions. If I had not had to say that I <em>saw</em> you,
and that the bracelet was mine, perhaps, oh! <em>perhaps</em> that
dreadful jury would not have said you were——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped suddenly and shuddered, sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could not speak the obnoxious word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their <em>saying</em> that I am guilty does not <em>make</em> me so,
even though I must pay the penalty as if I were. But I
have the consciousness <em>within</em> that I am innocent of the
crime, and I shall live to prove it yet to you, Editha, and
to all the world,” he answered, in clear, confident tones,
with a proud uplifting of his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not <em>need</em> to prove it to me, Earle; I <em>know</em> it
already. I would take your word in the face of the whole
world and a thousand juries,” Editha asserted, with unshaken
confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>A glad light leaped into the young man’s eyes, and
illuminated his whole face for the moment, at these words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” he replied, in low, thrilling tones, and
bending toward her: “it will be very pleasant to remember
what you have said while I am——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped short—he could not finish the miserable
sentence.</p>

<p class='c007'>His sudden pause reminded the young girl anew of
what was to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle! Earle!” she cried, passionately, her face growing
white and agonized, “I <em>cannot</em> have it so! Three years!
three long, long, wretched years! Oh, if I could only <em>do</em>
something! If I could only find those wretches who did the
deed for which <em>you</em> must suffer; if—oh, it is too, too cruel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, my little friend!” he said, bending nearer and
speaking with deep tenderness; “your sympathy is very
sweet and comforting to me, but it will unman me if I see
you suffer so on my account.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will be calm. I am thoughtless to wound you,
when you have so much to bear already,” she interrupted,
choking back the sobs that heaved her breast, and making
an effort to be calm.</p>

<p class='c007'>His lip trembled slightly as her blue eyes met his, so
full of sympathy and sorrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God knows that this <em>is</em> a fearful trial to me,” he went
on, drawing a deep breath, to free himself of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>choking sensation in his throat; but, trying to speak more
hopefully: “I am young, and three years will soon pass.
I shall spend them to some purpose, too; and, Editha, with
the knowledge of <em>your</em> trust and faith in me, I shall be able
to bear them patiently, and I shall come forth from the
strange discipline better prepared, I have no doubt, to battle
with life than I am at this moment. Every hour that is my
own I shall spend in study; and, if <em>you</em> will continue to have
faith in me, I promise you shall never have cause to blush to
own me as a friend in the future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle,” Editha replied, quietly, yet earnestly, now entirely
self-possessed, “you are just as brave and noble as
you can be, and I am proud of you as my friend to-day—now—this
moment! I shall think of you every day; I shall
<em>pray</em> for you every day; and, if they will let me, I will come
once in a while to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, <em>no</em>; please do not, Edie. I could not bear that <em>you</em>
should see me <em>there</em>,” he cried, sharply, his face almost
convulsed with pain at the thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, no—I did not think; but you <em>would</em> not like it;
but I want to do <em>something</em> to comfort you and let you
know that I do not forget you,” she said, sadly, a troubled
look on her fair face. “Will they let me send you things?”
she asked, after thinking a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that is allowed, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I shall send you something as often as I can; and
you will be comforted a little, will you not, Earle, if you
know you are remembered?” she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed I shall,” he said, deeply touched. “If I receive
a flower, a book, a paper, even, I shall be greatly cheered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shall have them. Every week I will send you
something, and you will know that there is one true friend
who has faith in you,” she said, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God bless you, Miss Dalton. You are a little comforter,
and my heart is lighter already. I have another friend—your
uncle; he has been very kind, and has fought hard
for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Uncle Richard! I believe he <em>is</em> one of the best
men that ever lived,” Editha said, as her eyes sought a
noble-looking man who was talking in an earnest and somewhat
excited manner to a group gathered about him, and
who had been Earle’s lawyer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall ever have cause to remember him gratefully. He
did not give me much encouragement regarding the issue
of the case—the evidence was so strong against me—and
as we could get no clew to the real culprit, he feared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>worst. But he promised to help me in my studies, should
the case go against me, so that I may be ready for the bar
when the term expires. So you see that things are not
quite so dark as they might be,” Earle said, trying to speak
hopefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha sighed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The future looked dark enough at the best, she thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we could but have had more time—if you might only
have another trial. Could you not have appealed, Earle?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook his head sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It could have done no good. The really guilty ones have
covered their tracks, and hidden their booty so effectually,
that we could get no clue. But do not grieve for me, my
little friend. Other innocent men have suffered for the
guilty, and it can be no harder for me than it was for them.
And,” lowering his voice, and speaking reverently, “I do
not forget that there was once a Man who suffered for the
sins of a <em>whole world</em>. For thirty-four years He meekly
bore His cross, praying at the end that His enemies might be
forgiven; and since He sees fit to send this one upon me,
I must not murmur, though I own ’tis hard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was weeping quietly now. The tears would come
in spite of her, though she marveled at his words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, Editha, I have an engagement at four, and it
lacks only fifteen minutes of that hour now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words were spoken in cold, measured tones at her
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fair girl started, flushed, and glanced around at the
speaker in surprise, as if unaccustomed to being addressed
in that manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, papa, I will come; but I wanted to say good-by
to Earle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, yes—ahem! I’m truly sorry for poor Earle,” Mr.
Dalton said, addressing him with a good deal of coldness
and a very poor show of sympathy, while he glanced impatiently
at his daughter. “Very unfortunate complication
of circumstances,” he went on, his gold repeater in his
hand, and his eyes watching attentively the minute hand
as it crept toward the hour of his engagement. “The evidence
was strangely conclusive, and I wish for <em>your</em> sake
it could have been refuted; but really, Editha, we must not
delay longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne bowed coldly to the would-be comforter,
and stepped back as if to end the interview.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>He knew Mr. Dalton was no friend to him, and his words,
which contained no sincerity, were intolerable to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by, Miss Dalton,” he said, holding out his hand
to Editha, and which she had dropped upon hearing Mr.
Dalton’s stern tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>That gentleman frowned darkly at the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>What right had a criminal to offer his hand to <em>his</em> daughter?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-bye, Earle,” she answered, clasping it warmly,
while a big tear trickled down her cheek and dropped hot
and burning upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she turned quickly away, drew her vail over her
tear-stained face, while Mr. Dalton led her from the room,
himself bestowing only an indifferent nod upon the offending
culprit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='large'>THE ROBBERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>About three months previous to the events related in the
preceding chapter, on a dark and stormy night, two men
might have been seen prowling around a stately mansion
in an aristocratic portion of the city of New York. After
carefully reconnoitering the premises, to see that no one
was stirring within, one of them cautiously proceeded to cut
out a pane of glass in one of the basement windows, while
the other kept watch upon the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The glass was removed without the slightest noise, whereupon
the burglar unfastened the window and lifted the sash.
Then making a little noise like the twittering of a sparrow,
he was immediately joined by his companion, and both disappeared
within the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few minutes later a third man coming along the street,
saw the sudden glimmer of a light in one of the lower rooms
of the mansion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something about it instantly attracted his attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a quick, sharp flare, and then seemed to go suddenly
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>He waited a minute or two, and the same thing was
repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha! a burglar!” he muttered to himself. “I think I’ll
have to look into this thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped, and his first impulse was to turn and go in
search of a policeman.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Ah! if he had done so how much of future misery would
have been saved him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But upon second thought he concluded not to do so, and
quietly slipped within the shadow of the great porch over
the front entrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed a long time that he stood waiting there, and
he regretted that he had not gone for an officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not know how long the burglars had been there,
and he had feared they would escape before he could return.
But finally he heard cautious steps approaching from the
rear toward the corner where he was stationed, and now he
caught the sound of exultant whispers, that they had been
so successful as to get out undiscovered with their rich
booty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next instant two men emerged into view, bearing
their plunder in a bag between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a bound the new-comer darted forward and felled
one man to the ground with a blow that sounded like the
descent of a sledge-hammer, and then grappled with the
other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The burglar who had been felled had been only momentarily
stunned, and, almost instantly recovering himself,
he had quietly picked up the bag, which had also fallen to
the ground in the melee, and made off with it, leaving his
companion to shift for himself as best he could.</p>

<p class='c007'>The combatants fought bravely and well, but the assailant
being lighter than the burglar, and less experienced in
pugilistic practice, gradually lost ground, and finally a well-directed
blow from his antagonist laid him flat at his feet,
when he, also, beat a hasty retreat, having first dropped
something on the ground beside his victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Steps were now heard approaching upon the pavement;
the noise of the scuffle had reached the ears of one of the
protectors of the peace, and he was hastening to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c007'>A light at the same time appeared at a window in one
of the lower rooms of the mansion so lately robbed, while
above a sash was thrown hastily up, and a slight, white-robed
figure leaned forth into the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The light in the window below streamed directly out upon
the fallen hero—alas! a hero no longer—who now began
to gather himself and his scattered senses together once
more. As he arose to his feet a cry from above rang out
on the stillness of the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Earle! Earle! how came you here, and what is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The voice was that of Editha Dalton, and, springing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>forward under the window, the young man replied, reassuringly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not be alarmed, Miss Editha. I have had a fall, but
am all right now. I’ll come and tell you to-morrow how I
happened to be here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, so, my fine young gentleman, you’ll come and tell
the lady to-morrow, will you? I’m thinking mayhaps you
will have a chance to tell some one else by that time, you
disturber of the peace;” and, before Earle Wayne could
scarcely realize what had happened, a pair of steel bracelets
were slipped about his wrists, and he was a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have made a mistake, sir,” he said civilly, to his
captor, yet beginning to feel very uncomfortable in the
position wherein he found himself. “I was trying to stop
a couple of thieves who had just robbed this house, when
one of them knocked me down and cleared.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes; I find I always get hold of the wrong rogue—some
one else does the deed and the one I catch is always
so ‘innocent,’” laughed the policeman, with good-natured
sarcasm. “Aha! what have we here?” he cried again, as
his foot came in contact with some glittering object and
sent it spinning on before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stooped to pick it up, and, as the light fell upon it,
he saw it was a costly bracelet, set with a solitare diamond
surrounded with emeralds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That looks ‘innocent,’ don’t it now?” he said, holding
it up to the light with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is Miss Dalton’s bracelet; I’ve seen her wear it,”
the young man thoughtlessly and injudiciously admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, no doubt; and you thought mayhaps that them
glittering stones might bring a pretty little sum. I came
just in time to stop this little game. Come, I think I can
accommodate you with lodgings to-night, my hearty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment a man came out of the house upon the
balcony in great excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help! help!” he cried. “I’ve been robbed! Stop thief!
stop——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, I <em>have</em> stopped him, and just in the nick of time,
sir,” responded the policeman, leading Earle into view.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Earle Wayne!</em>” exclaimed Mr. Dalton, in greatest astonishment,
as his glance fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, it is I; but I am no thief, as you very well
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, this does not look like it!” interrupted the policeman,
flourishing the bracelet conspicuously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have committed no robbery,” asserted Earle, with quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>dignity; “and I did not see that bracelet until you picked it
up and showed it to me. It must have been dropped by one
of the robber, who fled after I was knocked down;” and
he went on to explain how he happened to be there, and
what he had seen and heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a likely story now, isn’t it, sir,” sneered his captor,
who was all too eager for the <em>eclat</em> of having captured
the perpetrator of so daring a theft, “when I’ve found him
with his booty right here on the spot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton,” Earle appealed, fearing he had got himself
into a bad predicament, “you know well enough that
I would do no such a thing, particularly in this house of
all others;” and he glanced in a troubled way up at that
white-robed figure in the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, certainly not. Papa, we know <em>Earle</em> would not
be guilty of any thing of the kind, and I believe every word
he has said about the encounter with those men,” Miss
Dalton asserted, confidently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you see or hear any one else, Editha?” asked her
father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I heard a heavy fall, and after listening a minute
I came to the window, where I saw Earle just getting up
from the ground; and see! as the light shines upon him
he looks as if he had been having an encounter with some
one;” and she pointed at the young man’s disarranged
and soiled clothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mr. Dalton shook his head, while the policeman
sneered. It looked bad, and the presence of the bracelet
seemed to them indisputable proof that he was in some
way criminally connected with the affair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further investigation proved that a quantity of silver,
and all of Mrs. Dalton’s diamonds, together with quite a
large sum of money, had been stolen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Wayne was closely questioned as to who his accomplices
were, for the policeman insisted that he must
have had one or more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make a clean breast of it, young one, and being your
first attempt, perhaps they will let you off easy,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Earle indignantly refused to answer any more questions,
and was at last led away to the station-house and
locked up until his case could be officially investigated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning papers were full of the robbery, and the
young man’s name figured largely in their columns, while
much was said about the “culpable hardihood and stubbornness
of one so young in years, but apparently so old in
crime.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>A day or two after the case was investigated, and, no
further light being gained upon the affair, he was committed
for trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard Forrester, a lawyer of note and a brother of
Mrs. Dalton, in whose employ the young man had been
for the past three years, immediately gave bonds for him to
the amount of ten thousand dollars, and for the next three
months devoted himself assiduously to working up the complicated
case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day for Earle Wayne’s trial came, and only the
following facts came to light:</p>

<p class='c007'>His character, up to the night in question, as far as any
one knew, was unimpeachable.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been in Mr. Forrester’s employ for three years,
and during that time had gained that gentleman’s entire
confidence and kind regard, and he had even contemplated
making him a partner in his business as soon as he had
completed his course of study and been admitted to the bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke at some length, and in glowing terms, of his
honesty and industry, and said he had deemed him, if anything,
<em>too</em> rigid and morbidly conscientious upon what
seemed to him points of minor importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this spoke well for the prisoner, but it did not touch
upon the matter under consideration, and could not therefore
be accepted as evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that on the afternoon before the robbery Earle
had asked permission to go out of town on business for
himself. He had not stated what that business was, neither
had Mr. Forrester inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, however, the question came up, but Earle refused
to state it, and this of itself turned the tide strong against
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had obtained leave to leave the city on a train that
left at two in the afternoon, and had gone to the village
of ——, only eighteen miles out.</p>

<p class='c007'>He transacted his business, which concerned only his
private interests, he said, and this much he could also say,
“was connected with the events of his early life,” and returned
to the city by the late train, which arrived about
midnight.</p>

<p class='c007'>On his way from the station to his lodgings he was obliged
to pass Mr. Dalton’s house, where he saw, as already described,
the light within one of the lower rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stated that his first impulse was to go for a police
officer, but fearing the man—he had not thought there would
be more than one—would be off with his booty before he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>could return, he resolved to remain, encounter the villain
single-handed, and bring him to justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then went on to describe his tussle with the two
ruffians.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he had only his own word with which to battle all
the evidence against him. His story did not sound reasonable,
the jury thought, particularly as he so persistently
refused to state the nature of his business to the village
of ——; and besides, the fact of the bracelet having been
found in his possession, or what amounted to the same thing,
was almost sufficient of itself to convict him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, if you could only tell this business of yours, perhaps
we might be able to do something for you; otherwise
I see no chance,” Mr. Forrester had urged, when the opposing
counsel had made such a point of his refusal to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot, sir. It is connected with a great wrong committed
years ago, and involves the name of my mother. I
<em>cannot</em> unveil the past before the curious rabble gathered
here—no, not even if I have to serve out a ten-years’ sentence
for keeping silent,” Earle said, firmly, but with deep
emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s evidence—since she was the first to see and recognize
him on the night of the robbery—went further than
almost anything else toward condemning him, even though
it was given with such reluctance, together with her oft-asserted
belief that he was innocent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tender-hearted, loyal girl would rather have had her
tongue paralyzed than to have been obliged to speak the
words which so told against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was cross-examined and recross-questioned, but he
told the same story every time, never swerving in a single
particular from his first statements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every possible way was tried to make him confess who
his accomplices were, the opposing counsel maintaining that
he must have had one or more. But he always replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had no accomplice, for I have neither planned nor
executed any robbery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you assert that two men came out of the house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I encountered two men at the corner of Mr. Dalton’s
house; one I surprised and felled to the ground, and then
grappled with the other. During the scuffle the first one
got up and ran off with the bag which contained their booty.
I then received a blow which stunned and felled me, and
when I came to myself again both were gone. I know
nothing of either them or their plunder, and I am innocent
of any complicity in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>But all was of no avail against the positive evidence which
opposed him, and the fatal verdict was spoken, the fearful
sentence pronounced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Popular sympathy inclined strongly toward the unfortunate
young man, whom many knew and respected for his
hitherto stainless character, while his appearance, so noble
and manly, prepossessed almost every one in his favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>As before stated, he had come to Richard Forrester when
a youth of seventeen, asking for work, and the great lawyer
had employed him as an office boy, and it was not long
before he came to feel a deep interest in the intelligent lad.
He saw that he had what lawyers term “a long head,” and
could grasp all the details of a case almost as readily as he
himself could, and he resolved that he would educate him
for the profession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Forrester was a bachelor of great wealth, and exceedingly
fond of his beautiful and vivacious niece, Editha
Dalton, who, report said, was to be his heiress.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a slight, sprightly girl of fourteen when Earle
Wayne came into her uncle’s employ, and a mutual admiration
sprang up between them at once, and steadily increased,
until, on the part of the young man, it grew into a deep and
abiding love, although he had never presumed to betray it
by so much as a look or tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, at seventeen, had not as yet analyzed her own
feelings toward her uncle’s <em>protege</em>; and thus we find her
at the time of the trial pouring out her impulsive regrets
and grief in the most unreserved manner, while her tender
heart was filled with keenest anguish at the fate of her <i><span lang="fr">beau
ideal</span></i> of all manly excellence.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for Mr. Dalton, he did not share the faith of either
his daughter or his brother-in-law; and, notwithstanding
he was vastly astonished upon discovering Earle Wayne in
the hands of a policeman at his own door on the night of
the robbery, yet he was a man who could easily believe almost
anything of one whom he disliked.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did dislike Earle, simply because Editha showed him
so much favor; and he was rather glad than otherwise now,
if the truth were known, that this very fascinating young
hero was to be removed from his path, even though he was
to become a prisoner. He began to fear that she had already
grown to admire him more than was either wise or
proper, considering the vast difference in their relative social
positions; and it would never do for the aristocratic
Miss Dalton, heiress-expectant, to fall in love with an <em>office
boy</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>And so Earle Wayne went to prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he went with a stout heart and a manly courage that
very few possess who are doomed to drag out a weary term
of years behind bolts, and bars, and solid walls.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='large'>A FRIEND IN NEED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I did not do it. I have not <em>that</em> on my conscience to
weigh me down. I am to suffer for another’s crime, and
though it is a bitter trial, yet it is better so than that I was
really guilty and could go free. I had rather be in my place,
dreadful as it is, than in that of the real thief, and I will
make my misfortune serve me a good turn in spite of all.
I will fit myself for the very highest position in life, and
then, when my three years are ended, <em>I will go out and
occupy it</em>. I will not be crushed. I will rise above the disgrace.
I will live it down, and men shall yet be <em>proud to
call me friend</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So mused our hero as, for the first day in —— prison,
he was doomed, according to the rules of that institution,
to solitary confinement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne’s was no weak nature, to yield himself up
to useless repining and vain regrets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The die was cast, and for the next three years he was to
be like any other criminal, and dead to all the world, except
that portion of it contained within those four dreary walls,
and the one or two outside who should continue faithful to
him. Nothing could help it now, unless the real thieves
should confess their crime, which they were not at all likely
to do, and he bravely resolved to make the best of his situation,
hard though it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went cheerfully to his work; he uttered no complaint,
he sought no sympathy, and improved every hour that he
could call to his own to the utmost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard Forrester proved himself “a friend in need” at
this dark time. Obtaining permission of the authorities,
he stocked a bookcase for Earle with everything needful
to complete a thorough course of study, and drafted a plan
for him to follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once in three months he visited him, and between each
visit he received from him a synopsis of what knowledge
he had acquired during that time, which he criticised and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>returned with many useful hints, and then, when he came,
talked it all over with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was surprised during his visits to see how thorough
and clear he was upon all points which he had been over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, my boy,” he said, at one time, “you will make a
better lawyer than I, and I do not see where you find time
for all that you have learned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have nothing to distract my mind here, you know, and
<em>I will not brood over my fate</em>,” he replied, with a sad smile,
“so it is easy to concentrate my thoughts, and I learn
rapidly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much better it would be for all these poor fellows
here if they could do the same, and be prepared for a better
life when their time is out,” said Mr. Forrester, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most of them, instead, are only laying plans for more
desperate deeds than they have ever yet been guilty of; and
I begin to think that these severe measures of the law, instead
of reforming men, only tend to arouse their
antagonism and make them worse,” Earle answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what would you do with them? They have violated
the laws and must be made to suffer for it in some way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is true; if they do mischief they must be put
where they will be restrained; but in order to reform them,
and create a desire within them for higher and better things,
I think only such men as are actuated by the highest principles—men
who are honest, brave, and true—should be
allowed as officers within the walls of a prison. No man
can accomplish any <em>real</em> good where he is not respected,
and there is no one in the world so quick and keen to detect
a fraud as these criminals. There are a few men here who
are just in the right place—men who would not be guilty of
a mean or dishonorable act, and who, while they treat every
one with kindness, and even courtesy, yet demand exact
and unhesitating obedience. It is astonishing, and sometimes
amusing, to observe how differently they are respected
and treated from the others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You believe, then, that these men might be reformed by
kindness and judicious treatment?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do,” Earle replied, gravely; “of course there are exceptions,
but I really would like to see the power of true, disinterested
kindness tried upon some of these reckless
fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In after years he did see it tried, and of the result we
have yet to tell.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>Upon leaving the court-room with her father, after bidding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Earle good-by, Editha appeared very much disturbed
and kept shooting indignant glances from beneath her vail
at her unconscious companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last, when they were seated in their carriage, and
rolling smoothly toward home, her wrath broke forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, I think it was real shabby of you not to shake
hands with Earle, and express a little genuine sympathy for
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know as I particularly desire to shake hands
with, or that I experience any great amount of ‘genuine’
sympathy for, the man who is supposed to have robbed
me,” returned Mr. Dalton, with exasperating indifference.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa Dalton! you <em>know</em> Earle Wayne did not rob you
as well as I do,” Editha said, her eyes sparkling angrily;
for the sweet little maiden <em>could</em> show anger upon occasion.
“And as for myself,” she continued, spiritedly, “I am <em>proud</em>
of him; I was proud to shake hands with him before the
multitude, and I shall be proud to greet him as my friend
when his term expires and he comes among us again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very likely,” Mr. Dalton answered sarcastically, his thin
lips curling with scorn; “and after the very marked exhibition
to-day, I should be prepared to know of your being
‘proud’ of him in almost any capacity. But pray, Editha,
do not <em>gush</em> any more about it; it’s all very well for a
young lady to express her sympathy and proper feeling in a
proper way and at a proper time; but it was exceedingly
mortifying to me to-day to see you carry quite so much
sail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Editha tossed her pretty head somewhat defiantly
and impatiently at this curtain lecture, but a vivid scarlet
burned upon her cheeks, showing that she felt its stinging
force, notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton continued, with increasing sarcasm:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You and the young culprit formed the center of attraction
during your tender little episode, and I doubt not,
almost everybody thought you were taking a heart-broken
leave of your lover, instead of a poor <em>protege</em>—a mere
nobody—whom your philanthropic uncle had picked up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha had started violently as Mr. Dalton spoke of Earle
as her “<em>lover</em>,” and the burning blood rushed in a flood to
her brow, over her neck, arms, and hands, and tingled to
the very tips of her toes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could it be possible that she had behaved in so unmaidenly
a manner, and given the gaping multitude such an
impression?</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne her lover!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>She had never had such a thought before; but a strange
thrill shot through her heart now, bowing the defiant, sunny-haired
head, and making the sweet blue eyes droop half
guiltily.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she quickly rallied, and, tossing back the waves of
hair from her flushed face, she bravely returned to the
combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, and if he were—if—he were—what you have said
of him, papa, I should <em>still</em> be proud of him, and—I’d be
<em>true</em> to him, too. I’d <em>marry</em> him—<em>yes</em>, I <em>would</em>—just as soon
as ever he got through with those hateful three years;” and
she enforced her words with an emphatic tap of her small
boot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton leaned back in the carriage and laughed
heartily at this spirited outburst.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the whole, he rather enjoyed seeing his charming
daughter in a passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not often that he had the opportunity, for she
was generally the happiest and gayest of maidens, and,
being an only child, no cloud had ever been allowed to overshadow
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mr. Dalton had been extremely annoyed at the scene
in the court-room, deeming it vulgar in the extreme to be
made so conspicuous before the rabble, and he had uttered
words sharper than had ever been addressed to the petted
child before during all her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Editha was true and loyal to the core, and, when
once she had made a friend, no adversity could turn her
from that friend; and her whole nature had arisen to
arms against the cruel injustice and wretched fate which
had condemned one so noble and good as Earle to durance
vile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her father’s laugh capped the climax; the excitement,
the pain in her heart, and, above all, his last insinuation,
had been almost more than she could bear; but when his
hearty laugh rang out so full of mocking amusement, she
could endure no more, and, girl fashion, she burst into
tears, believing herself the most deeply injured and abused
maiden in existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, come, pet, don’t take it so much to heart; but
in the future try and be a little less demonstrative,” Mr.
Dalton said, somewhat moved by her tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Edith was deeply wounded; her tears must have their
way now, and not another word was spoken during their
drive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once at home, she darted into the house and up to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>own room, where, after she had wept her weep out alone,
and something of the burden from her heart, she sat down
to think.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her cheeks burned hotly every time she recalled her
father’s light words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle Wayne my lover!” she murmured, with tremulous
lips, and burying her face in her hands, with a feeling
of shame that she should dare to think of it, when
Earle, doubtless, had never dreamed of such a thing himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, the words possessed a strange fascination
for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she knelt in prayer and spoke his name, claiming
Heaven’s tenderest care for the smitten one, the burning
flush returned to her cheek, the thrill to her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle Wayne my lover!” she repeated, softly, as she laid
her head upon her pillow, and her dreams were full of a
manly face, with deep, dark eyes, in which shone a light
tender and true, with lips that wore a smile as sweet and
gentle as a woman’s, but such as no woman’s ever wore
for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She still seemed to feel the clasp of his hand, the charm
of his low spoken words, and the music of his voice and,
when at length she awoke with the break of day, she was
gay, careless Editha Dalton no longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A graver, quieter light looked out of her sunny eyes as
she arose and dressed; lines of firmness and decision had
settled about the smiling, happy mouth, and all the world
had a deeper meaning for her than ever before.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Standing, with reluctant feet,</div>

      <div class='line'>Womanhood and childhood fleet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was as if she had suddenly turned a new page within
her heart, and read thereon something which was to make
her life in the future more beautiful and sacred, and yet
which brought with the knowledge something of regret for
the bright and careless days now gone forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>She remembered that this was Earle’s first day in prison—the
first of those long, long three years—and the tears
sprang to her eyes, a sob trembled on her lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was only a few hours since she had seen him, but it
seemed as if weeks had passed; and, if they had been so
long to her, what must they have been to him?</p>

<p class='c007'>Could he ever endure it? Could she ever wait with
patience so long?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>She could not go to him—he had said he could not bear
to have her see him there—and so she had nothing to do
but wait.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I will not forget him,” she murmured; “let papa
say what he may, I have promised to be a friend to him,
and I shall keep my promise. He has no one in all the
world, or seems to have no one, save Uncle Richard and
me. Every week I will send him something, just to let him
know that there is one, at least, who cares a little and is
sorry for him.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='large'>THE GREAT UNKNOWN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A year went by.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Editha Dalton it seemed to fly as if with magic wings,
for she was yet a school-girl, and this last year was filled
with study and practice, and with all the bustle and excitement
attendant upon preparing for graduating.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Earle Wayne it passed in a slow, tedious, monotonous
manner, with its changeless daily routine to and from
the workshops and simple meals; its never-varying sights
and sounds, bolts and bars. But notwithstanding he grew
intensely wearied with all this, and oftentimes even heart-sick,
yet his courage and his purpose never wavered. Every
day was filled to the last moment with usefulness. Every
day, when his task was completed, he drew forth his book
and spent the remaining hours in study, storing his mind,
increasing his knowledge of his chosen profession and preparing
to carve out for himself a future which, in spite of
his present misfortune, he fondly hoped would command
the respect of all who knew or should ever know him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was cheerful and patient, performed his tasks with
alacrity, and without the grumbling so usual among convicts;
and, by his never-varying courtesy and good behavior,
he won for himself the commendation of the officers, the
good-will of his companions, and, better than all, the days
of grace allotted to those who are not reprimanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every week on Saturday—the day on which any one may
receive remembrances from their friends in the way of
fruit, flowers, and other delicacies—there came to him some
little token, that made his heart beat and thrill with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes it was a simple bunch of rosebuds, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>expanding day by day, blossomed at length into full glory,
cheering and filling his gloomy cell with their beauty and
fragrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes it was a box of lilies of the valley, or violets,
or heliotrope and myrtle blossoms; at others, a tempting
basket of fruit, with a book or periodical of some kind;
and Earle knew that his little friend had not forgotten him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Faithfully, never missing a single day, they came for a
year, when they suddenly ceased, and he received them no
more.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one can realize how the poor prisoner missed these
bright evidences of remembrance, nor how eagerly he still
looked for them every Saturday for a long time, thinking
that perhaps Editha was away or sick, and could not send
them for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has forgotten me, after all,” he sighed, sadly, after
several months had passed and he had not received a single
flower; and it seemed almost as if death had bereaved him—of
some dear one as he returned to his lonely cell at night,
after his daily task was ended, and there was no sweet perfume
to greet him, no bright blossoms to cheer him.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that remained to comfort him was a little box filled
with dried and faded flowers that he had not had the heart
to throw away, and the memory of the brightness that had
been.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what was the reason of all this?</p>

<p class='c007'>Had Editha forgotten?</p>

<p class='c007'>Had she, amid the busy cares which occupied her time
and attention at this time, grown careless and neglectful?</p>

<p class='c007'>No. It happened in this way:</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of a year she graduated, doing honor to both
her instructors and herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a day apart for public exercises, when the
graduating class appeared before their many friends to
show what they were capable of in the way of essays,
poems, and other accomplishments, and to receive their
diplomas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s poem was greeted with enthusiasm, a perfect
storm of applause testifying to the appreciation of the public;
whole floral offerings were showered at her feet, until there
were enough to have stocked a florist in a small way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Selecting the choicest of them all, she inclosed both
bouquet and poem, together with a little explanatory note,
in a box, and dispatched it to Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, Mr. Dalton encountered the servant who
was bearing this box to the express office, confiscated it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and enjoined silence upon the bearer regarding its untimely
fate. The poem he preserved, but the flowers were ruthlessly
cast into the flames.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll put a stop to all this nonsense,” he muttered, as
he watched their beauty blacken and shrivel upon the glowing
coals; and from that day he took care that the lonely
prisoner should receive no more flowers or tokens of remembrance
from his little friend, who, though she never once
failed to keep her promise, was yet destined, through the
enmity of another, to appear unfaithful to her promises.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second year passed, and it was a year fraught with
events of pain and sorrow for our beautiful Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Dalton died—a woman of fashion and folly, but
always kind, in her way, to Editha; and though there had
never been as much of sympathy and harmony between them
as there should be between mother and daughter, yet it left
her very lonely, and occasioned her the deepest grief that
the one whom she had always called by that sacred name
should be taken from her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Six months later Richard Forrester suddenly sickened,
and from the first they knew that it was unto death.</p>

<p class='c007'>This blow appeared likely to crush Editha, for “Uncle
Richard” had always been her friend and sympathizer.</p>

<p class='c007'>To him she had always carried all her griefs, her hopes
and fears (for which no one else appeared to have neither
time nor interest); and she ever found him a ready listener,
and came away comforted and lightened of her burden,
whatever it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>If she wanted a particular favor, it was to Uncle Richard
she applied. He gratified every childish whim or wish, no
matter what it was or what expense, time, or trouble it
involved.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was her confident, too; all her little school-girl secrets
were whispered unreservedly in his ear, and, as she grew
older, all her plans were submitted to his judgment rather
than to that of either father or mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>He always discussed them with her as with an equal, and
as if they were as interesting to him as to herself, while
her parents were liable to say, indulgently, yet with evident
annoyance:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do as you like, child, but I am too busy to attend to
anything of the kind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From the moment of his attack, Mr. Forrester had insisted
upon the presence of Editha at his bedside; and there
he lay and watched her, with his heart in his eyes, as if he
knew he was looking his last upon the fair face and sunny-haired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>head that had been so dear to him for so many
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been stricken with paralysis while pleading a case
in the court-room, and was brought to his home never to
leave it again until he was borne forth by other feet, and
laid away from the sight of men forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>His body was almost paralyzed, but, strange to say, his
brain was clear, and he arranged regarding the disposal of
many thing which were not mentioned in his will, and concerning
the last services that were to be observed over his
own body.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My little girlie,” he said, tenderly, to Editha one day, as
she sat beside him, holding one of his numb and withered
hands, and longing to do something to relieve his helplessness,
“you have always loved Uncle Richard a little, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little!” she said, choking back a sob. “No one in all
the world has ever been to me what you have been. You
have been my confidant—my most intimate friend. I have
never been able to go to papa, nor to poor mamma while
she lived, and tell them my troubles as I have to you. I
don’t know why it was, but papa always laughed at and
teased me, and mamma was too busy to attend to me. But
you always put by everything and listened to me. Uncle
Richard, I believe—I ought not to say it, perhaps, but I can
just whisper it to <em>you</em> now—I believe I love you best of any
one in all the world;” and Editha laid her cheek against
his in a fond way that told how very dear he was to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear child,” the dying man said, with starting tears
and trembling lip, “your words are very precious. I have
been a very lonesome man for—for many years, but you
have been a great comfort to me. Now, I want to talk very
seriously to you for a little while. Do you think you can
bear it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but—but I am afraid it will not do for you to talk;
the doctor said you must not have any excitement,” Editha
said knowing full well what subject was uppermost in his
mind and shrinking from talking about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will not make any difference now, Edie, dear—a few
hours or less will not matter to me——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Richard!” gasped the girl, as if she could not
bear it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, we both know that death must come to me
soon,” he said, gently, but with a sad smile; “the parting
<em>must</em> come. If I do not get excited, I suppose I may live
a few hours longer; but I have some things that must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>be said, whether they excite me or not, and which I can
say only to you; and, as I said before, a few hours will not
matter. Do not weep thus, my darling; I cannot bear <em>that</em>,”
he added, as the golden head dropped upon his breast and
Editha wept rebelliously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Richard, you are my only real friend; I cannot,
<em>cannot</em> let you go. What shall I do without you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Edie, dear, you must not give way thus—you must be
brave and calm; it excites me more than anything else to
see you grieve so,” he said, huskily, as his lips pressed her
shining hair, and his eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>She raised her head instantly and made an effort at self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will not trouble you any more. Forgive me;”
and her red lips sought his, so pale and drawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right, dear do not let this, our last hour, perhaps,
be wasted in tears and vain regrets. You know, Edie,” he
continued, after a few minutes’ thought, “or, at least, I
suppose you know, that I am considered to be very rich.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but oh! if we could only give it all and have you
well again,” she mourned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; gold is valueless when one comes to lie where I am
to-day, and there is nothing a man would not give in exchange
for his life; but that is something over which we
can have no control, and so it is well at all times to be
ready to go when we are called. But I want to tell you
that several years ago I made a will, and made you my
heiress; I have never had any one to love as I have loved
you, and all that I accumulated was laid by for you. But
now——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped, and a look of trouble and anxiety swept over
his features.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what?” Editha asked; “have you any other wish
now? I shall not care and everything shall be just as you
would like it to be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, dear; and that is just the unselfish spirit
that I like to see in you, and I know that you will make a
good use of your fortune. But I <em>have</em> another wish; it
is something that I intended doing myself, but have unwisely
kept putting it off, and now I must leave it for you
to carry out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you for trusting me to do so, whatever it may
be,” Editha said, feeling deeply touched and grateful that
he should deem her worthy to carry out any plan of his.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From the first,” he said, “I have been deeply interested
in Earle——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Editha started at the name, and the rosy tide swept over
her fair face, while her eyes drooped half guiltily, as if she
feared he suspected something of what her father had
hinted so long ago regarding Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sick man observed it, and he regarded her keenly
for a moment, then heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He came to me, you know, dear,” he went on, “a poor,
friendless boy of seventeen, and I, attracted by his honest
face and engaging manner, gave him a place in my office.
I was not long in discovering that I had found no ordinary
character, and I resolved I would cultivate his talents, make
a lawyer of him, and, when he should attain a proper age,
make him an equal partner in my business. But you know
the unfortunate circumstances which have blighted his career,
and will mar it all his life——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Uncle Richard, I do not believe that,” Editha interrupted,
firmly. “I know well enough that Earle is innocent
of any crime, and I believe he will rise above all his trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I, too, believe him innocent, and suffering a grevious
wrong; but, unless his innocence is proven to the world, the
disgrace of his imprisonment will cripple him all his life—the
world will always sneer at and scorn him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>I</em> shall not, Uncle Richard; when he comes back to us,
I shall be his friend just as I always have been, and I shall
defend him wherever I go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard Forrester’s fading eyes lighted with admiration
as they rested upon the spirited face beside him, and he
listened to these brave and fearless words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am proud of you, Editha, for standing up so bravely
for the right, even though others may curl the lip at you
for doing it. It is no wonder that I love you, dear,” he
added, with wistful tenderness; “if—if I only might have
had—ah! what was I saying?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped suddenly, while a shudder shook him, and
Editha, not understanding his last words, feared his mind
was wandering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently, however, he resumed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what I wanted to tell you was this: Since Earle’s
misfortune I have planned to do something for him as soon
as his time expires. He will be fitted for the bar by that
time if he follows the course I have marked out for him,
and I intended offering him a partnership with me; or, in
case he did not feel like remaining here, giving him something
handsome with which to start life somewhere else.
But I can do neither now—I cannot even add a codicil to
my will, as I would like to do, in his favor, I am so helpless;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and he glanced down at his palsied hands with a heavy
sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is just like you, Uncle Richard; but he can have
the money even if you are not able to change your will,”
Editha said, in a glad tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that is what I want; when he comes out from that
dismal place he will feel as if every man’s hand is against
him, and I want him to be independent until he can win his
way and establish himself somewhere. I want you, Editha,
to give him ten thousand dollars; I shall leave you a very
handsome fortune, dear—more than a hundred and fifty
thousand, and you will not miss that sum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed! Earle shall have twice that, if you would
like. I do not need so much money, for I have papa to take
care of <em>me</em>, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard Forrester’s lips curled slightly at her last words.
No one knew better than he <em>how</em> Sumner Dalton had been
able to provide as handsomely as he had for his family
during the past years. But he said, positively:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Editha, just ten thousand and no more; and, if he
is the man I think he is, he will double it himself in a little
while. Earle Wayne will make a noble man, but—there is
some mystery connected with his early life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A mystery! Of what nature?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know; he would not tell me, and that business
of his that he went to transact on the day before the robbery,
you remember, he said was connected with his past, and
he would not reveal it; and that was one reason why the
trial went against him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I remember; and I have often wondered what it
could be,” the young girl answered, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are perfectly willing that he should have a portion
of your fortune?” he asked, regarding her intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not only willing, but very <em>glad</em>, Uncle Richard,” she
replied, heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>He heaved a sigh of relief, as if that was a burden off his
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He could not legally claim anything, even if he knew
of my wish to give him this, because my will leaves you
everything but you will settle upon him this amount as soon
as his time is out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I promise you that I will do <em>exactly</em> as you wish;
and, Uncle Richard,” she added, with a little smile, “you
know that you have always taught me that I must keep my
promises.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right, and now there is one thing more. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>private drawer of my safe there is a sealed package belonging
to Earle, and which he committed to my care for the
time of his imprisonment. This I also give into your hands
to keep for him, and when you settle the money upon him
you can return it to him; and <em>under no circumstances allow
the seal to be broken</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not. I accept this as a sacred trust, and I will
be faithful to the letter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, dear; that is all, I believe; and now”—with
a yearning look into the sweet, flushed face—“you will not
forget ‘Uncle Richard’—you will always think kindly of
him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As if I could ever think of you in any other way,” Editha
said, reproachfully, and with starting tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My life has not been all smooth, darling. In my younger
days there were things that happened which I could not help
and yet—and yet”—with a shadow of pain on his brow—“perhaps
I <em>might</em> have helped them in a degree if I had tried.
But if—if you should ever hear anything that seems strange
or wrong to you, you will try not to blame me—you will
love me still?” he pleaded, yearningly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Richard, you cannot ever have done anything so
very wrong. You must not talk so; if you do, I shall not
be able to listen to you calmly. I shall break down in spite
of myself, and I must not for your sake,” Editha said,
brokenly, and feeling as if her heart must burst with its
weight of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, well, dear, I will say no more, and it is pleasant to
know you trust me so. You cannot know <em>how</em> much I have
always loved you. You have been like a little green oasis
in the desert of my heart; always a source of comfort and
joy to me. I hope, my darling, that nothing will ever cloud
your future; but if there should, you will still love and
think of me kindly—you will not blame Uncle Richard for
anything?” he still persisted, as if some great and sudden
fear had overtaken him at the last moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—no, indeed. I cannot bear it. How strangely you
talk!” the fair girl said, deeply distressed by his words, and
fearing that death was taking the strength and vigor of his
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know—I know; I ought not to trouble you thus; but”—with
a deep-drawn sigh—“there are so many sad things in
life. God bless you, my darling—my <em>own</em> darling—God
ever bless and keep you from all sorrow and harm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He lay silent for several minutes, looking up into her
face, as if he knew it was the last time, and he must fix
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>its every lineament upon his memory before the great unknown
wrapped him in its mystic folds.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length he whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now kiss me, dear, and go out into the fresh air. I
have kept you too long; your cheeks are pale, your eyes are
dim. I fear I have been selfish to keep you here so much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha stopped with a sob and kissed him upon his lips,
his cheek, his eyes, his hair, with passionate fervor, and
then went away, glad to be alone for a little while, that she
might give vent unrestrained to her nearly breaking heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sick man watched her with fond and longing eyes, as
she glided from the room, and then murmured, prayerfully:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven grant that <em>that sin</em> may never shadow <em>her</em> life.
Farewell, my sweet Editha—the only gleam of real happiness
my life has ever known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When early morning came, dim and quiet, and chill with
the heavy dew, the palsied limbs had grown cold and stiff;
the great heart had ceased its sluggish beating; the sightless
eyes were closed; the noble face had settled into peace,
and the soul had passed through death’s portal and waked
in Paradise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, Richard Forrester was dead; and thus his life flowed
out from its mysterious urn into the great unknown.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='large'>“I SHALL KEEP MY PLEDGE”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Richard Forrester’s affairs were duly settled, and his
property—an exceedingly handsome property, too—passed
into the hands of Editha Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young girl had grown wonderfully womanly and dignified
during the last two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not like the careless, sparkling, impulsive Editha
who had so dauntlessly stood up in the crowded court-room
and defended the hero of our story on that sad day when he
received a felon’s doom.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was more grave and self-contained, more thoughtful
and dignified, but not a whit less sweet and attractive.</p>

<p class='c007'>If anything, the gentle gravity of the deep blue eyes, with
their steady, searching glance, possessed a greater charm
than when they had been so full of mirth and laughter; the
calm, self-possessed manner was more fascinating than the
careless gayety of the light-hearted school-girl.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>She persisted—much to her father’s inward vexation and
disgust, for he had fondly hoped to have the handling of
her money matters—in going over all her uncle’s papers,
and becoming thoroughly acquainted with all the points of
business pertaining to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had said he felt sure she would make good use of
the fortune which he had left her, and she knew that, in
order to do so, she must understand in the beginning everything
concerning it.</p>

<p class='c007'>So she listened with the strictest attention while the
prosy lawyer whom Richard Forrester had appointed to settle
his affairs explained, now and then putting an intelligent
question, which showed that her mind was strong and clear
to grasp every detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would allow no one save herself to examine the
private drawer of Richard Forrester’s safe, although Mr.
Dalton stood by chafing at her obstinacy, and longing to
see for himself what it contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found, as she expected, the package belonging to
Earle, of which her uncle had spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you there, Editha?” her father asked, as,
after examining its address and seal, she was about to return
it to the drawer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is something—some papers, I think, that belonged to
Earle,” Editha answered, and he noticed the flush that
sprang to her cheek as she pronounced his name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me see it,” he said, holding out his hand for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can examine the outside, papa, if you like; but the
package is not to be opened,” she said, as she reluctantly
handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed! and by whose authority do you speak so emphatically?”
Mr. Dalton demanded, with a sneer, as he
curiously examined the bold, clear writing upon the wrapper,
and wondered what secrets it contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Uncle Richard’s, papa,” Editha replied, firmly, the
flush growing deeper on her cheek at his sneer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke oftener now to her in that way than he had
ever done before, and not a day passed that he did not
wound her deeply, and make her feel as if her only remaining
friend was becoming alienated from her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton, on his part, was very much chagrined that
she should presume to act so independently.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a great disappointment to him that he could not
control her large income, which he had intended should
contribute as much to his own enjoyment as to hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Money was his god; not to hoard and keep, but for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>pleasure he could get from it; and <em>he</em> knew how to live
for <em>that</em> end as well as any one in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Editha, after acquainting herself thoroughly with the
details of her position as her uncle’s heiress, had again
committed everything into the hands of Mr. Forrester’s
lawyer, Mr. Felton saying he was to manage for her just
as he had done for him, and it was better he should do so,
since he understood everything, than to make any change.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By your Uncle Richard’s, eh?” repeated Mr. Dalton, as
he still regarded the package belonging to Earle Wayne.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; the last day of his life he gave me some directions,
and among other things committed these papers to
my keeping until Earle’s time should expire, and charged
me <em>under no circumstances to allow the seal to be broken</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw! what a fuss over a little mess of papers; and
what can it matter to any one if we look inside? It is sealed
with a regular seal, too. I have considerable curiosity to
know what silly secret the young convict regards so
sacredly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think it is very kind, sir, to speak of Earle
in that way; and, whether it is silly or not, it <em>is</em> his secret,
and no one has any right to it but himself,” Editha answered
with dignity and some show of spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems to me you are unaccountably interested, and very
valiant in your defense of a convicted criminal,” retorted
Mr. Dalton, considerably irritated by his daughter’s independence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am deeply interested in Earle Wayne, papa; he was
my friend before he was so unfortunate; he is my friend
still,” she bravely returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you even intend to take him under the shadow
of your sheltering wing when he comes out of prison?” he
sneered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall certainly not withhold my friendship from him
while he is in every way worthy to retain it; and
besides——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Besides what?” Sumner Dalton asked, with blazing eyes,
as she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had no idea that there was so much fire and spirit
bottled up in the little lady, who until quite recently had appeared
to him only a light-hearted, sweet-tempered child.</p>

<p class='c007'>True, she had been willful at times, but he had not minded
it when it was confined to the little things of childhood, and
never having had any other children, it had been a pleasure
to pet her and indulge her in everything.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had hitherto always laughed when she opposed him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and often teased her for the sake of arousing her antagonism,
which made her appear so pretty and brilliant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, however, it was another matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was setting up her will in stubborn opposition to his,
and upon matters of vital importance to him, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had no notion of allowing her to compromise herself
by befriending a miserable criminal, and he was bound to
put a stop to it in some way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Besides what?” he repeated, as she did not immediately
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked at him askance, as if she was somewhat doubtful
of the propriety of telling him anything more.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at length she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know that Uncle Richard was also deeply interested
in, and entertained a high regard for Earle——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please adopt a different way of speaking of him; I do
not like you to use his name so familiarly,” interrupted Mr.
Dalton, with an angry tap of his foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well; for Mr. Wayne, then,” she said, flushing;
“and, during my last interview with him, he said he regarded
him as a young man of great ability and promise, and that
he had intended, as soon as he was fitted for the bar, to
make him a partner in his business. All this he was going
to do for one whom <em>you</em> appear to hold in such contempt, and
as soon as his time should expire, if he would accept it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do believe that Richard Forrester was born with a soft
spot somewhere, after all,” began her father, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, and it was <em>in his heart</em>,” Edith interrupted,
quietly, but with an ominous sparkle in her blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could not tamely listen even to her father if anything
disparaging was said of her beloved Uncle Richard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton glanced at her as if resenting the interruption,
and then continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was keen enough in business and in making money,
but he has shown himself almost an imbecile about some
other things during the forty years that he had lived.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, do you forget that you are speaking of the dead?”
Editha asked, in a low, constrained tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but I have no patience with such foolishness as
he has more than once been guilty of,” was the impatient
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What has Uncle Richard done that is so very foolish? He
told me on that last day that his life had not been all smooth.
What has he done?” Editha asked, with evident anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No matter—no matter,” Mr. Dalton said, hastily; then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>as if anxious to change the subject, asked: “Is that all
you were going to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but I’m afraid you will be even more displeased
with the rest of it than with what I have already told you,”
the young girl said, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At all events, let me hear it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He said if he had not been so helpless he would have
added a codicil to his will, and given Ear—Mr. Wayne
something handsome to start in life with, when his three
years should expire——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he made me promise that I would settle ten thousand
dollars upon him just as soon as he should be free,
and at the same time return his package to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ten thousand dollars!” exclaimed Sumner Dalton
aghast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe it, Editha Dalton. It is more like a
sickly, sentimental fancy of your own,” was the excited retort.
Mr. Dalton was furious at the thought. Ten thousand
dollars of Editha’s fortune to be given away to a beggar
and a criminal!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe it, I say! Such a monstrous proceeding
could never have originated in the brain of a sane man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, was I ever guilty of telling you a falsehood?” the
young girl demanded, turning upon him, all the pride of
her nature aroused by his words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not that I know of; but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then do not dare to accuse me of it now. I am telling
you only truth, and the wishes of a dying man. Uncle
Richard’s wishes in this respect are sacred to me, even if
my own heart and my friendship for Mr. Wayne did not
prompt me to do him this little kindness out of my
abundance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little kindness! It would not take very many such <em>little
kindnesses</em> to make a beggar of yourself,” sneered Mr. Dalton,
wrathfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I pledged myself to execute this wish just as soon as
Earle’s time expires, and I shall fulfill my pledge to the
letter,” Editha returned, somewhat proudly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I know it, Miss Dalton. Such folly—such rashness,
I could never allow you to be guilty of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa,” she began, pleadingly, her face full of pain, her
eyes full of tears, “why are you so changed toward me
lately? You and I are all that are left of our family. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>have no near relatives; we are almost alone in the world.
Do not, <em>please</em> do not, let there be any estrangement, any
disagreement between us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton’s face softened for the moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not, my dear,” he replied, adopting his usual
fond tone and manner, “there need be no estrangement, no
disagreement, if you will be reasonable; but, of course, I
cannot allow you to squander your money in the way you
propose doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My money! How came it mine? Whose was it before
it became mine?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Richard Forrester’s, of course,” he said, with some uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and before it became mine he reserved this ten
thousand to be given to Earle. Surely he had a right to
do with his own as he would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very true; but you forget—his will was made years ago,
giving you <em>everything</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did not know Earle then; but he <em>said</em> if he could
only have the use of his hands, he would have added a
codicil to his will in his favor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he did <em>not</em> do it. The will stands just as it always
has, and he can claim nothing. No part of your fortune
is <em>legally</em> his.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told me it was his <em>wish</em>, and I shall give Earle the
money,” Editha answered, firmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will <em>not</em>,” asserted Mr. Dalton, positively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, do you know how much I am worth in all?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A hundred and seventy-five thousand strong—a handsome
fortune, a <em>very</em> handsome fortune for a young girl
like you to possess,” he said, rubbing his hands together
with an air of satisfaction, as if he expected to reap no little
benefit from the said fortune himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is more than Uncle Richard thought, owing, no
doubt, to the successful sale of that block I did not wish to
keep and Mr. Felton advised me to sell. Uncle Richard told
me there would be more than a hundred and fifty thousand;
but you see I have nearly twenty-five thousand more than
he expected; and, even after giving Earle what he wished,
I shall have more than he thought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What nonsense, child!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not nonsense. The money was set apart for him,
and I should be a thief and a robber not to do with it as I
was bidden. I have promised, and I shall fulfill,” Editha
returned, steadfastly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not with <em>my</em> consent, miss,” Mr. Dalton cried, hotly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Then it will have to be done without it,” she answered,
sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That cannot be; you are under age; you are only nineteen,
and it will be more than a year before you are free to
act upon your own authority. Meantime, I am your legal
guardian, and you can transfer no property without my consent,”
her father replied, triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that so?” Editha asked, with a startled look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is so, according to the law of this State.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, you cannot mean what you say. You <em>must</em> allow
me to do this thing; you would not be so dishonorable as
to withhold this money from Earle when it is really his. He
has only about nine months longer to stay——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A year, you mean,” Mr. Dalton interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; his ‘days of grace’ amount to three months, and so
he will be free in about nine; and he will be absolutely
penniless—he will have nothing upon which to begin life. It
would be cruel to keep this money from him when it is rightfully
his, and he will need it so much. Pray, papa, be kind
and reasonable, and let me do as Uncle Richard wished,”
pleaded the fair girl, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Richard Forrester didn’t know what he wished himself,
or he would never have been guilty of such folly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, you <em>know</em> that his mind was as clear as either
yours or mine is at this moment,” Editha exclaimed, nearly
ready to weep at this cruel opposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It does not matter; I shall never consent to your fooling
away ten thousand dollars in any such manner; so let this
end the controversy at once,” he returned, doggedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor Earle!” sighed Editha, regretfully; “then he’ll have
to wait a whole year for it. It is too bad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a <em>year</em> for it—what do you mean?” demanded Mr.
Dalton sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean, papa, that if I cannot give it to him without
your consent, that he will have to wait for it until I am
twenty-one. But the very day that I attain my majority I
shall go to Mr. Felton and have him make over ten thousand
dollars to Earle Wayne,” and the gentle blue eyes met
his with a look that told him she would do just as she had
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you defy me, then? You will not dare!” he cried,
actually quivering with anger at her words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have promised, and—I <em>shall keep my pledge</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha had grown very pale, but she spoke very firmly
and steadily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton shot a dark look at the defiant little figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>standing so quietly opposite him, and muttered an oath
under his breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, apparently thinking it unwise to say more upon
the subject just then, he turned his attention again to the
package which he still held in his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s eyes followed his, and she held out her hand,
saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will replace that in the safe now, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder what there is in it?” he said, curiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her lip curled a little, but she made no reply, still standing
with outstretched hand, waiting for him to give it to
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve half a mind to open it,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>No, indeed!</em>” she cried, in alarm, and taking a step
forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw! it can do no harm—it cannot contain anything
so <em>very</em> remarkable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, pray do not allow me to lose <em>all</em> the respect I have
for my own father,” Editha cried, sternly, her eyes ablaze,
her face flushing a painful crimson, her form dilating with
surprise, indignation, and grief.</p>

<p class='c007'>A peculiar, mocking laugh was all the reply he made to
this, but he handed back the package; not, however, without
inwardly resolving to ascertain, before very long, what
it contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha hastily returned it to the private drawer, locked
it and the safe securely, and then, without a word, left the
room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='large'>WHAT WAS IT?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sumner Dalton was a supremely selfish man.</p>

<p class='c007'>From his earliest boyhood his chief aim had been to get
gold, no matter how, that he might fill his life to the brim
with pleasure, and his highest ambition was to walk among
the proudest of the land, and mingle in their enjoyments
as an equal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naught but a golden key would unlock the door leading
into these charmed regions, therefore gold became his idol.
When everything went smoothly, he was easy and tolerably
good-natured; but when opposed or disappointed by any one
in his plans or schemes, it was anything but pleasant for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>those about him, and he did not allow an opportunity to
pass to revenge himself of the offense.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not believe in grieving his life away for the dead;
people must die and be buried; the world was made for the
enjoyment of the living, and it was his maxim to improve
those pleasures to the utmost while he lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>His wife died the last of October, Richard Forrester the
following April; and in June, when the hot weather came
on, he told Editha to prepare for the season at Newport as
he intended spending the summer there as usual, with, perhaps,
a trip to Saratoga and Long Branch, by way of
variety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, with her heart saddened from her recent bereavement,
would have much preferred remaining quietly at
home; feeling, too, that there was more of comfort there in
its large, airy, and beautiful rooms than in a crowded, fashionable
hotel, where, at the most, she could have but two
or three apartments, and those comparatively small and
close.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she had no heart for the glitter and confusion of
society; those two dead faces, so cold and fixed, were too
fresh in her memory for her to take any pleasure in the
gayeties of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>She ventured a protest when Mr. Dalton spoke of his
intentions, but he peremptorily silenced her by asking her
if she supposed she was going to have everything her own
way since she had go to be an heiress.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had treated her very coolly, and they had seemed to
be growing farther and farther apart ever since that spirited
interview regarding Richard Forrester’s bequest to Earle
Wayne.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edith was deeply hurt that he should consider her so
selfish and willful, and finally said she would go to Newport
if he wished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do wish it; and, Editha, I want you to leave all that
somber black trumpery at home, and put on something gay
and pretty,” he added, with a disappointing glance at her
mourning robes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa! surely you do not mean me to take off my mourning!”
she exclaimed, in blank astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I do; there can be no possible good in wearing such
gloomy-looking things; they are perfectly hateful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But mamma has only been gone about nine months, and
Uncle Richard not quite three, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>A quick rush of tears into the sad blue eyes and a great
choking lump in her throat suddenly stopped her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Your mother would not wish to see you in such dismal
garments; she could never endure black anyway; and your
Uncle Richard would much prefer to see you looking bright
and cheerful,” replied Mr. Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha knew this was true, but it seemed almost like
treason to her beloved ones to lay aside all evidence of her
sorrow and go back to the gay habiliments of the world.
But she submitted to this <em>edict of Dalton</em> also for the sake
of peace; and though she could not bring her mind to assume
gay colors, yet she bought charming suits of finest
white cambric and lawn, and muslins delicately sprigged
with lavender, with richer and more elegant damasse, silk
and lace, all white, for evening wear.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was an exceedingly simple wardrobe, yet rich and
charming withal, and even her fastidious father could find
no fault when he saw her arrayed in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night before they were to leave, at midnight, Sumner
Dalton might have been seen creeping steadily downstairs
and into Editha’s private library.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a room that had once been her mother’s morning
sitting-room, and where she had had all her uncle’s books,
pictures, and safe removed after his death, and here she
spent much of her time, reading the books he had loved,
sewing a little, painting a little, and thinking a great deal
of the friend who had been so very dear to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton acted as if he felt very much like an intruder
or a thief as he glided noiselessly into this room, closing
and locking the door after him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went directly to the safe; taking a bunch of keys from
his pocket, he selected one and proceeded to unlock it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did the foolish little chit think to keep her secrets from
me?” he sneered, as he easily turned the lock and the door
swung noiselessly back. “She’ll find she will be obliged
to use more stratagem than she possesses in her small head
before she can outwit an old one like mine,” he continued,
as he proceeded to search every drawer the safe contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>None was locked save the private drawer in which he
had seen Editha place Earle’s package, and he found nothing
of any interest in any of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Selecting another key from his bunch, he quickly opened
the private drawer, and a grunt of satisfaction immediately
escaped him, showing that now he had found what he
wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took it out, and the light revealed the package which
Edith had sought to treasure so sacredly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was always something mysterious about that proud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>scamp,” he muttered, eyeing the package curiously; “and
now, if there is anything here to tell me who and what
he is, I’m going to know it. He said his business <em>that
night</em>,” he continued, reflectively, “concerned only his own
private interests, and was connected with his early life; perhaps
I shall learn something more about those ‘private interests’
and ‘early life.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>He removed the light from the floor where he had put
it to see to unlock the safe, to the table, seated himself
comfortably in a revolving chair, took out a handsome
pocket-knife, and, in the most careful and delicate manner
imaginable, removed entire the heavy seal of wax from the
package.</p>

<p class='c007'>Putting this in a place of safety that no harm might come
to it, he removed the wrapping of heavy paper and began to
inspect the contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>They consisted chiefly of letters addressed to Earle, in
a delicate, feminine hand, the sight of which made Sumner
Dalton start violently and grow a sudden crimson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw!” he said, impatiently, and drawing a deep
breath, “there are hundreds of women who write a similar
hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He opened one or two of the letters and read them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were all dated from a little town in England, and
were addressed to “My dear son,” and simply signed “Your
loving mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was not much of interest in them to him, only
now and then there was an expression which seemed to
touch some long dormant chord of memory, and made him
shiver as he read.</p>

<p class='c007'>He soon grew weary of this occupation, however, and
laid the letters aside to examine further.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were several pretty drawings wrapped in tissue paper,
a sketch, in water-colors, of a charming little cottage,
half hidden by vines and climbing roses, and in one corner
of this there were three tiny initials.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton nearly bounded from his chair as he read
them, repeating them aloud as he did so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The color forsook his face, his lips twitched nervously,
and a startled, anxious expression sprang to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>He hastily thrust the drawing one side and went on now
more eagerly with his quest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only remaining things in the package were a large
envelope, containing a few photographs, and a very heavy
piece of parchment—more like cardboard—about five inches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>wide and eight long, and upon which there was some writing
in cipher that he could not read.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to be there more as a foundation to build the
package than anything else, and Mr. Dalton, attaching no
importance whatever to it, pushed it one side and turned
his attention to the pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'>One by one he took them up and looked at them, but
there was no familiar face, and they were mostly pictures
of young boys and girls, evidently schoolmates of Earle’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he came to what seemed to be one carefully inclosed
in a separate envelope.</p>

<p class='c007'>He opened this, and found that its contents were wrapped
about with tissue paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some pretty girl who has captivated his boyish fancy.
Who knows but it may be a picture of Editha herself?” he
muttered, with a scornful smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>He removed the wrapper, and two pictures dropped upon
the table, and also a lock of auburn hair, tied with a blue
ribbon.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took up one of the pictures with a yawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely this was not worth the loss of so much sleep and
the treachery he had employed to gain his object.</p>

<p class='c007'>But—what is this?</p>

<p class='c007'>Something that makes the blood rush back upon his heart
with suffocating force, his eyes to start with horror, and a
clammy moisture to ooze from every pore.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the face of a beautiful woman of perhaps thirty-five
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dark, abundant hair crowned the small, shapely head set
most gracefully upon a pair of sloping shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grave, sad eyes looked up at the horror-stricken face
with an expression which strangely moved the strong man.</p>

<p class='c007'>A straight, delicate nose and a mouth sweet and gentle
in expression, but deeply lined with suffering, completed the
picture. Underneath, and traced in the same delicate chirography
which the letters bore, were the words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother, to her dear boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With trembling hands Sumner Dalton laid it down and
took up the other picture, and gazed as if fascinated upon
it. It was the same face, only evidently taken fifteen or
twenty years previous.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a magic face, one of bewildering, entrancing beauty,
and full of mirth and careless glee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rippling curls that caught the sunlight with every breath;
dancing eyes of loveliest expression; the same straight, delicate
nose as seen in the other likeness, and a sweet mouth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>whose bright and careless smile told of not a care in all the
world. This was the picture that held Sumner Dalton spellbound
with a strange horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Underneath, in the same delicate hand, were the three
tiny initials that he had seen upon the sketch in water-colors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strong man groaned aloud as he looked; the photograph
dropped from his nervous fingers, and he shook like
one with the ague. He wiped the sweat from his brow; he
rubbed his eyes as if to clear his vision, and looked again,
comparing the two faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>But only to groan again more bitterly than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>There could be no doubt that both pictures were of the
same person, only taken at different times; one during happy
girlhood days, the other at a maturer age, and to gratify the
wishes of her son.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Earle Wayne her son!</em> Earle Wayne, the prisoner, the—criminal!
Great heaven!” he cried, with ashen lips, and
in tones expressive of intense horror and fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a round oath, he threw both pictures from
him as if they burned him, and, leaping to his feet, began
pacing excitedly back and forth upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What shade of evil has sent this thing to confront me
at this late hour of my life?” he cried, with exceeding bitterness.
“Did I not have enough of disappointment and
regret to bear at <em>that</em> time without being reminded of it in
this way now? I was cheated, foiled out of what I would
almost have given half a life-time to have attained. Oh!
if I had only known—<em>why</em> was there no one to tell me?
<em>Why</em>——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped in the midst of his walk, and clenched his hands
and ground his teeth in fiercest wrath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was a fool!—an idiot! I hate myself, I hate her—I
hate all the world, who <em>knew</em> and did not tell me. And
<em>he</em> is <em>her</em> son, <em>he</em> is——</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! I have never loved him any <em>too</em> well—I love him
far less now, for—<em>he is a living monument of my defeat</em>.
No wonder he is proud; no wonder he bore his trial with
such fortitude, if he possesses a tithe of the spirit and resolution
that <em>she</em> possessed and displayed more than twenty years
ago. I wish he had five times three years to serve; but I’ll
crush him when he comes out, as I would like to crush
every one who knew at <em>that time</em>, and did not tell me. He
may go to the ——. It is nothing to me if he <em>is</em> innocent,
and yet a prisoner. It shall not disturb me, and I will not
have my enjoyment destroyed by this grim phantom of the
past. I’ll cast care and worry to the winds, be merry, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>go my own way; but—let <em>him</em> look out that he does not
cross <em>my</em> path again,” he concluded, with a fierceness that
was terrible to observe.</p>

<p class='c007'>He lifted his head defiantly as he uttered those words,
but continued pacing back and forth for another half-hour,
muttering constantly, but indistinctly, to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ugh! but it gives me a sickly feeling in spite of myself,”
he said at length, as he went back to the table and began
to gather up the papers scattered there.</p>

<p class='c007'>He folded the pictures in their wrappers as he had found
them, putting the auburn lock of hair between them, though
the touch of it sent the cold chills down his back and another
fierce oath to his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>He gazed curiously again at the piece of parchment with
the peculiar writing upon it, and wondered if it contained
any meaning of importance but he at last arranged everything
just as he had found it, folding the outside wrapper
carefully over all.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then melted a little wax from Editha’s stand, and
dropped upon it to fasten it, after which he carefully pressed
the original seal into its proper place.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was all very neatly and nicely done, and no one save
an expert would ever have imagined that the package had
been tampered with at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>He replaced it just as he had found it in the private
drawer of the safe, locked it, closed and locked the safe,
and then stole noiselessly away to his own chamber, and
to bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But no sleep came to him that night, “to weigh his eyelids
down, or steep his senses in forgetfulness.” Visions
of the past seemed to haunt him with a vividness which
appeared to arouse every evil passion in his nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>He tossed incessantly on his pillow, and groaned, and
raged, and swore, first at himself and then at all the world,
for some wrong, real or imaginary, which he had suffered
during the earlier years of his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some secret he evidently had on his mind, which filled
him first with remorse and then with anger; and so the
night wore out and morning broke, and found him haggard,
hollow-eyed, and exhausted from the storm of fury which
had raged so long in his soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was it?</p>

<p class='c007'>What was this strange secret connected with his previous
history with Earle Wayne, and with the beautiful woman
whose pictures he had found in the package which had
been given into Richard Forrester’s hands for safe keeping?</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='large'>EDITHA’S RESOLUTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Everybody who knows anything about Newport—the
Brighton of America—knows that the season there is one
long scene of gayety, pleasure, and splendor.</p>

<p class='c007'>And this year bade fair to eclipse all previous years
owing to the unusual brilliancy and elegance of its entertainments,
its incessant round of pleasure, the presence of
numberless beautiful women, with their magnificent toilets,
and the great number of distinguished guests from abroad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among these latter one in particular seemed to attract
great attention, on account of his noble personal attractions,
the report of his great wealth, and, more than all,
because of his being unmarried, handsome, and—thirty.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was an F. R. C. S., had graduated with high honors,
and the reputation of his skill was in everybody’s mouth,
while it was stated upon the best authority that he was heir
prospective to large estates in both England and France,
though where they were situated, and of their extent, no
one seemed to know.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tressalia, allow me to present to you my daughter,
Miss Dalton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the introduction of Paul Tressalia, the distinguished
stranger, to Edith Dalton, as performed by Mr.
Dalton, one golden summer evening, as Editha sat by herself
upon the broad piazza of their hotel, musing rather
pensively upon the events of the past two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha lifted her large blue eyes, which filled with instant
admiration as they rested upon the handsome stranger, and
she gracefully saluted him, realizing at once that she was in
the presence of a man of power—one of superior intellect,
and yet with a velvet hand withal, as the mild dark eyes
and the gentle expression of his mouth asserted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia, on his part, was evidently powerfully attracted
by those same large and expressive eyes, which were
reading his face with such a comprehensive glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>His gaze rested admiringly on the slender figure, with its
mien of blended grace, reserve, and dignity, attired, so simply
yet artistically, in its force of spotless embroidered
muslin; on the small head, with its silken aureate crown; on
the sweet face, so full of expression and the impress of latent
character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her small hands seemed to him like “symmetrical snowflakes,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>her feet like little mice peeping from beneath the
flowing robe, and all her movements full of “sweet, attractive
grace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia noted all this during the ceremony of introduction,
and realized at once that he had “met his fate”
in this being “fair as Venus,” whose</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Face and figure wove a spell</div>
      <div class='line'>While her bright eyes were beaming.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Editha had not mingled very much in the gayeties of
Newport as yet—she could not enjoy them; her heart was
sore and sad; she could not forget the two dear ones so
recently gone, nor the young promising life confined by
prison walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a day passed that Earle Wayne’s noble face did not
rise up before her, and she seemed to hear his rich, clear
voice asserting constantly, “Their <em>saying</em> that I am guilty
does not <em>make</em> me so. I have the consciousness within me
that I am innocent of a crime, and I will live to prove it
yet to <em>you</em> and the world,” and the knowledge of his cruel
fate was a constant pain. But now she was almost insensibly
drawn out of herself and her sad musings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia possessed a peculiar charm in his gentle
manner, and in his brilliant and intelligent conversation;
and, almost before she was aware of it, Editha found herself
joining and enjoying the party of choice spirits who seemed
to own him as their center.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ice once broken, who shall tell of the bright, delightful
days that followed?</p>

<p class='c007'>And yet in the midst of all this she did not forget Earle;
every morning on rising, and at evening on retiring, her
thoughts fled to that gloomy cell, with its innocent inmate
suffering for another’s crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every week she faithfully dispatched her floral remembrance;
but Mr. Dalton’s servant having received permanent
instructions upon that subject, they never left the
hotel, and were ruthlessly destroyed and their beauty lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>People were not long in discovering that the beautiful
heiress, Miss Dalton, was the charm that bound the distinguished
Mr. Tressalia to Newport, and the desirableness
and suitableness of an alliance between them began to be
freely discussed and commented upon; while, as if by common
consent, all other suitors dropped out of the field, as
if convinced of the hopelessness of their cause, and she
thereby fell to the charge of the young Englishman upon
all occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>But Editha began to feel somewhat uneasy at the way
matters were settling themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>She liked her new friend extremely; he was a man that
could not<a id='t45'></a> fail to command everywhere respect and admiration,
and she could not help enjoying his cultivated society;
but she did not enjoy being paired off with him, to the
exclusion of everybody else, upon every occasion; for her
woman’s instinct told her whither all this was tending, and
she knew it ought not to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton, however, was exceedingly elated over the
prospect, and took no pains to conceal his satisfaction, nor
to contradict the gossip regarding an approaching engagement,
while, at the same time, he was never weary of
recounting Mr. Tressalia’s merits to his daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at length Editha began to excuse herself from
accompanying him upon excursions of pleasure, and to
retire to her own rooms upon some slight pretext when
he joined them at evening on the piazza, her father became
highly incensed, and fumed and fretted himself almost into a
fever on account of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, you will oblige me by not being quite so indifferent
to Mr. Tressalia’s attentions,” Mr. Dalton said one
day, upon their return from a brilliant reception given on
board a French man-of-war lying at anchor in the harbor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commander was a friend of Mr. Tressalia’s, and had
given an elaborate breakfast and reception to him and his
friends, together with some distinguished people sojourning
at Newport.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha and Mr. Dalton had been among the guests, and
the former had been perfectly charming, in her dainty lawn,
embroidered with rich purple pansies, and her jaunty hat,
surrounded with a wreath of the same flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had attracted marked attention from commander and
officers, and also from many of the guests, and in this way
had succeeded in saving herself from the usual “pairing
off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been somewhat reserved, too, in her manner
toward Mr. Tressalia, and her father swore more than once
to himself at her evident avoidance of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She blushed at his remark, but said, very quietly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not aware that I treat Mr. Tressalia indifferently,
papa. He is a very pleasant gentleman, and I enjoy his
society exceedingly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why did you avoid him so persistently to-day?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would not appear to avoid any of our friends,” Editha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>said, with a deepening flush; “but really I do not enjoy
being monopolized by one person so entirely as I have been
the past two or three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What particular objection have you to Mr. Tressalia?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“None whatever. I repeat, he is a very cultivated and
agreeable gentleman, and I enjoy his society.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I desire that you may show a little more pleasure
in it,” Mr. Dalton returned, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In what way, papa? <em>How</em> shall I <em>show</em> my pleasure in
Mr. Tressalia’s society?” Editha asked, looking up at him
with a droll expression of innocence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton flushed hotly himself now. It was not an
easy question to answer, for, of course, he could not say
that he would like her to become unmaidenly conspicuous
in her pleasure, and it was rather a difficult and perplexing
matter to make a <em>rule</em> for her to follow, and one, too,
that would bring about the end he so much desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a question, Editha!” he exclaimed, after a moment’s
thought; “when you are pleased with <em>anything</em>, it
is not difficult to show it, is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; but then there are different degrees of pleasure,
you know; and, from the way you spoke, I thought perhaps
you desired me to adopt the <em>superlative</em>, and that, I fear,
would be ‘mortifying’ to you,” she said, with a sparkle of
mischief in her tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was laughing at him now, and Mr. Dalton did not
find himself in a very agreeable position.</p>

<p class='c007'>He remembered that he had once chided her very severely
for being so demonstrative, and cautioned her not to “<em>gush</em>,”
saying it was all “very well for a young lady to express her
feelings in a proper way, and at a proper time, but it was
<em>mortifying</em> to him to have her carry quite so much sail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha doubtless remembered it also, and referred to this
very lecture, judging from her words and manner, and for
a moment he hardly knew what reply to make.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think your sarcasm is a little ill-timed,” he at length
said, stiffly. “Mr. Tressalia has hitherto paid you marked
attention, and you have not demurred; but your avoidance
of him to-day could not fail to occasion him surprise and
pain, and also remark on the part of others. As for your
being monopolized by one person, as you express it, there
are very few young ladies in Newport who would not be
very glad to be chosen from among the many by a man
like Paul Tressalia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not Mr. Tressalia that I object to at all; it is the
idea of always being paired off with him, as if no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>gentleman had any right to approach me,” Editha said, with
heightening color.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You object to him, then, as a permanent escort?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, I do,” she answered, decidedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why, if I may ask?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I do not wish to accept attentions which might
lead Mr. Tressalia to imagine that I possess a deeper regard
for him than I really have,” Editha said, candidly, yet with
some confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you mean me to understand you regard Paul
Tressalia only in the light of a friend, and you are unwilling
that friendship should develop into any warmer sentiment?”
Mr. Dalton asked, with lowering brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir,” was the firm though low reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That places me in a very fine position; for—for—I may
as well out with it first as last—that gentleman has asked
my permission to address you with a view to marriage, and
I have given it;” and Mr. Dalton looked very much disturbed
and angry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, papa!” Editha exclaimed, in pained surprise, and
flushing deepest crimson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” he demanded, almost fiercely, while he eyed her
keenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very sorry you have done so, for it cannot be;”
and her voice trembled slightly as she said it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because—I can never care for him in any such way as
<em>that</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In any such way as what?” he asked, with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know what I mean well enough—the warmer sentiment
of which I have already spoken,” she answered, with
a rush of tears to her eyes at his unkind tone. She struggled
a moment for self-control, and then continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I admire Mr. Tressalia exceedingly; he is a man who
must command any woman’s respect and esteem; he is cultivated
and refined, and possesses one of the kindest, most
generous natures, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you don’t want to marry him, is that it?” he
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, I do not,” she said, very firmly, but with another
rush of color to the beautiful face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton’s face grew dark, and he twitched nervously
in his chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure I cannot conceive what possible objection you
can have to him as a husband; he is handsome as a king,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>polished, distinguished in his profession, and rich enough
to surround you with every elegance the world can afford.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have already told you my sole objection—I do not love
him,” the fair girl said, wearily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw! I am sure he is fitted to command the love of
any woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; he is very noble, very good, very attractive; and
I cannot tell you <em>why</em> I do not, but simply that I <em>do</em> not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you would not accept him if he should propose for
your hand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir,” was the low but very steady reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton’s eyes flashed ominously; he was growing
furious at her obstinacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had decreed that she should marry the distinguished
young surgeon, and who was reported heir to such large
possessions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that we have stated gold was Mr.
Dalton’s idol, consequently he was anxious to secure so
valuable a prize, so that in case his own supply of this
world’s goods should fail him, he would have an exhaustless
reservoir to which he could go and replenish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I desire that you consent to marry Paul Tressalia whenever
he sees fit to ask you to become his wife,” he said, in
tones of command.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I regret that I cannot gratify that desire, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <em>cannot</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you utterly refuse to do so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do most emphatically,” Editha answered, coldly and
decidedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps your affections are already engaged—perhaps
you have already experienced that passion you term ‘love’
for some one else?” her father said, half eagerly, half
sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have never been asked to marry any one; no one has
ever spoken of love to me,” she replied, with drooping lids
and very crimson cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was very cleverly evaded, Miss Dalton,” he returned,
with a mocking laugh. “I was not speaking of the
love of any one for <em>you</em>, but of <em>yours</em> for some one <em>else</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I decline to discuss the subject further with you, sir,
but refuse to accept Mr. Tressalia’s attentions any longer
with a view to an alliance with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Dalton was beginning to show her independent
spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps,” sneered Mr. Dalton, now thoroughly aroused,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and made reckless by her opposition, “your tastes would lead
you to prefer to marry that handsome young convict whom
you professed to admire so much once upon a time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton had had his fears upon this subject for some
time, owing to the constancy with which she sent him the
tokens of her remembrance; but he had never hinted at such
a thing until now.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s proud little head was lifted suddenly erect at his
words; her eyes, blue and gentle as they were usually, had
grown dark, and flashed dangerously; her nostrils dilated,
and her breath came quickly from her red, parted lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had touched upon a tender point.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa,” she cried, in proud, ringing tones, “if I loved
any one, and he was worthy, I should never be ashamed
of that love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor to marry its object, even though he had served a
sentence in a State prison,” he jeered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor to marry its object, even though he had served a
matter what misfortunes had overtaken him, nor what position
in life he occupied.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If Earle Wayne could have heard those words how he
would have blessed their author!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha!” her father cried, bitterly; “perhaps you <em>do</em> even
love this—this——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father!” Miss Dalton had risen now from her chair,
and stood calmly confronting the enraged man; but she was
very pale. “Father,” she repeated, “I cannot understand
why you should be so exceedingly bitter toward me whenever
I happen to differ from you upon any point; neither
can I understand the change in your general treatment of
me during the last two years. You used to be gentle and
indulgent with me until after mamma and Uncle Richard
died, and it is very hard for me to bear your scorn and
anger. But—please do not think I intend to be disrespectful
or willful—but I consider that neither you nor any one
else has a right to speak to me in the way you have done
to-day regarding a subject so sacred as the disposal of my
affections. They are my own, to be bestowed whenever and
upon whoever my heart shall dictate. Hear me out, please,”
she said, as he was about to angrily interrupt her. “I claim
that I have a perfect and indisputable right to judge for
myself in a matter so vital to my own interests and happiness,
and when the proper time comes—I shall exercise that
right. Do not misunderstand me. I have no desire to displease
you, nor to go contrary to your wishes. I would not
seem to threaten, either; but you have wounded me more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>deeply than you imagine to-day, and I must speak freely,
once for all. I cannot allow any one—not even my own
father—to dispose of my future for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I understand you to mean that you would marry a
man whom everybody looked down upon and despised, if
you happened to take a fancy to him?” Mr. Dalton demanded,
in a voice of thunder, and utterly confounded by
the girl’s independence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would make no difference to me whether <em>others</em> despised
him or not, if he was mentally my equal, and I considered
him worthy of my affection,” was the brave, proud
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even if disgraced as a felon, as Earle Wayne has been
disgraced?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even if he had <em>innocently</em> suffered disgrace, and expiated
another’s crime, as Earle Wayne has done, and is
doing,” she answered quietly; but the deep blue eyes were
hidden beneath the white lids; two very bright spots had
settled on her cheeks and her hands trembled nervously.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was cruel to wring her secret from her thus; but he was
her father and she must bear it as patiently as she could.</p>

<p class='c007'>His next words, however, acted like an electric battery
upon her.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were spoken hoarsely and menacingly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha Dalton, you are a fool and I would see your whole
life a wreck before I would see you wedded to <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, papa, for your flattering estimate of my mental
faculties, and also for the tender, fraternal interest which
you manifest in my future happiness; but if you please we
will close the discussion here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With uplifted hand, flashing eyes, and a haughty little bend
of her slender body, she glided quietly from the room.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Pride in her port, defiance in her eye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton looked after her in amaze, and ground his
teeth in baffled rage.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='large'>HOPES AND FEARS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Whew!” he exclaimed, after a moment, “my beloved
daughter is developing a surprising spirit. I had no idea
there was so much grit bottled up in her little body. I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>have to mind my p’s and q’s, or all my plans will amount
to nothing; it will not do to arouse her antagonism like this.
I must remember the wisdom of Burke, who sagely remarked:
‘He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves
and sharpens our skill; our antagonist is our helper.’ I
have no desire to strengthen <em>her</em> nerves, or sharpen <em>her</em>
skill—clearly, opposition won’t do for Editha Dalton; we
must employ winning smiles, soft speeches and strategy. I
must take heed to my ways, else my independent, fiery
little banker will yet be refusing me the handling of her
plethoric purse, and that, under the circumstances, is a
pleasure I should miss exceedingly. Nevertheless, I intend
to have my own way about certain matters and things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was Sumner Dalton’s muttered colloquy with himself,
after having been so abruptly left alone by his indignant
daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time past he had made large demands upon
Editha’s income, giving as a reason for so doing that he had
loaned largely to a friend of late, who, having failed to pay
as he had promised, he was somewhat crippled in his own
money affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, generous and tender-hearted to a fault, of course
credited his statements, and immediately surrendered the
most of her income into his hands, and it is needless to
remark that it slipped through his fingers in the easiest
manner imaginable, and he presented himself to her on
quarter-day with a punctuality that was a surprising, knowing
his habits, as it would in a better cause have been commendable.</p>

<p class='c007'>But for the present he said no more to her on the subject
of either Mr. Tressalia’s attentions or intentions.</p>

<p class='c007'>His manner was more affectionate and kind, and Editha
began to feel that she had perhaps spoken more hastily
and severely than she ought to her only parent; consequently
she exerted herself more to please him for the little
while they remained at Newport.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton, watching his opportunity, hinted to Mr.
Tressalia that perhaps it would not be well to hurry matters
to a crisis, even though they had only a few days longer to
remain at Newport; but he gave him a cordial invitation
to visit them in their city home, encouraging him to hope
that on a more intimate acquaintance he could not fail to
win the fair Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>That gentleman appeared to see the wisdom of all this,
particularly as he had noticed and been somewhat hurt by
her avoidance of him, and he did not force his attentions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>upon her, nor seek to monopolize her society as he had
heretofore done.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the last week of Editha’s stay at the sea-side was
marked by only pleasant events, and there was nothing to
look upon with regret as they returned to their home for
the winter.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the last of October when they left Newport, and
the twenty-third of December was the day set for Earle
Wayne’s release from prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had entered the tenth of April, but, according to the
State law, a prisoner was allowed two days of mercy in
every month for prompt obedience to the rules of the institution
and the faithful performance of all duties; consequently
he had gained during the three years, three months
and eighteen days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha knew of this through Mr. Forrester, and Earle
Wayne himself did not keep a more accurate account of
his time than did the fair, brave girl who, despite everything,
was so true and firm a friend to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first duty upon returning to her home was to write
him a little note.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Wayne</span>,” it ran, a little formal, perhaps, on account
of Mr. Dalton’s sneers and insinuations, “in about two
months I shall expect to shake hands with you once more.
Will you come directly to my home at that time, as I have
an important message for you, also a package belonging to
you and left in my care by Uncle Richard, just before he
died?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ever your friend,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>“<span class='sc'>Editha Dalton</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When this note was handed to Earle, and he instantly
recognized the handwriting, every particle of color forsook
his face, his hand trembled, and a mist gathered before his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not seen that writing since his lovely flowers had
ceased to come, and its familiar characters aroused so many
emotions that for the moment he was nearly unmanned.</p>

<p class='c007'>He thrust it hastily into his bosom, for he could not open
it with so many eyes upon him, and there it lay all day long
against his beating heart, waiting to be opened when he
could be alone and unobserved.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at last he did break the seal and read it, it was
sadly disappointing.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed cold and distant—a mere formal request to
come and get what belonged to him and receive the message
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>(doubtless something regarding his studies) which Richard
Forrester had left for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His heart was full of bitterness, for since Mr. Forrester’s
death he had not seen a single friendly face or received one
word of kindly remembrance from any one.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could not forget Editha’s long neglect of him—the
long, weary months, during which she had promised to send
him some token, and none had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had other cares and pleasures; her time was probably
occupied by her fashionable friends and acquaintances,
and it could not be expected that she would give much
thought to a miserable convict; doubtless she would not have
remembered him now had it not been a duty she owed to
the wishes of her uncle, he reasoned, with a dreary pain in
his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was, he knew, nearly or quite twenty now; she had
already been in society nearly two years, and, perchance,
she had already given her heart to some worthy, fortunate
man, who could place her in a position befitting her beauty
and culture; and what business had <em>he</em>, who would henceforth
be a marked man—a pariah among men—to imagine
that she would think of him except, perhaps, with a passing
feeling of pity?</p>

<p class='c007'>But even though he reasoned thus with himself, and tried
to school his mind to think that he must never presume to
believe that Editha could cherish anything of regard for
him, even though she had signed herself “ever your friend,”
yet he experienced a dull feeling of despair creeping over
him, and even the prospect of his approaching liberation
could not cheer him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had a little box in which he treasured some dried and
faded flowers—the last he had received from her—and he
looked at these occasionally with a mournful smile and a
swelling tenderness in his heart, and his eyes grew misty
with unshed tears as he remembered the sweet-faced, impulsive
girl who had so generously stood up and defended
him in that crowded court-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>He remembered how she had grieved over her own reluctantly
given evidence, which had gone so far toward
convicting him—how she had laid her hot cheek upon his
hand and sobbed out her plea for forgiveness, and her look
of firm faith and trust in him when she had told him that
he did not need to prove his innocence to her, she would
take his word in the face of the whole world.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strange thrill always went through him as he thought
of the burning tears she had shed for him and his sad fate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and which had rained upon the hand which she had held
clasped in both of hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a sort of sad pleasure to look back upon all this,
and think how kind she had been, and in his own heart he
knew that he loved her as he could never love another; but
he had no right to think of her in that way. If she had only
remembered him occasionally, it would not be quite so hard
to bear; but she had not kept her promise—she <em>had</em> forgotten
him in spite of her eager protestations that she would
not.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would gladly have gone away from the city as soon
as he should be liberated, and thus avoid the pain of meeting
and parting with her, but she had written and requested
it, and he must have his package again, while he would
treasure any message which his kind friend, Richard Forrester,
had left for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His eyes dwelt fondly over those three last words, “ever
your friend,” even though he sighed as he read them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were stereotyped, what she might kindly have written
to any unfortunate person; yet his face did brighten,
and they were like precious ointment to his bruised spirit,
and cheered the few remaining weeks of his stay not a
little.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I will obey her summons,” he said, with a sigh,
as he folded the tiny sheet, carefully replaced it in its envelope,
and then returned it to that inner pocket near his
heart. “I will go to her; I will look into her deep, clear
eyes and fair, beautiful face once more; I will touch her
soft hand once again, even if it be in a long farewell. I
shall hear her speak my name, and then I will go away from
her forever. To stay where I should be sure to meet her,
even once in a while, and perhaps to see her happy in the
love of another, would be more pain than I could bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, oh, my darling!” he cried, in a voice of anguish,
“if only this terrible blight need not have come upon me—if
I might but have won you, there would have come a day
when I could have given you such a position as—but, ah!
why do I indulge in such vain dreamings?—it can never
be, and God alone can help me to bear the dread future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet notwithstanding his despair of never being anything
but an object of pity to the woman whom he idolized, those
last two months of his stay were the brighter for the coming
of that little white-winged messenger which Editha had sent
him, and which day and night lay above his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle will be free the twenty-third—Christmas comes
two days later. I will have the papers conveying Uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Richard’s bequest made out and all ready, and he shall have
it for a Christmas gift, if I can get papa’s consent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Editha planned as the month of December came
in cold and wintry, and growing more and more impatient
with every succeeding day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa has been more kind to me of late—I do not believe
but that I can persuade him to sign the papers, and then I
will ask Earle to eat the Christmas goose with us. I will
make everything so lovely and cheerful that he will forget
those dreary walls and the long, long months he has been so
cruelly detailed there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But she realized, even as she mused and planned thus,
that she would doubtless have trouble regarding these matters;
and yet she hoped against hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa <em>cannot</em> be so cruel. I shall get Mr. Felton to
intercede for me—it is such a little sum compared with the
whole, and the money would do Earle so much good; it will
help him to hold up his head until he gets nicely started
in business for himself. I wonder if he is changed much?”
she went on, with heightened color and a quickly beating
heart, as she remembered the strong, proud face, with its
dark, handsome eyes, the tender yet manly mouth, which
used to part into such a luminous smile whenever he looked
up to her. “I wonder if he has liked my flowers?—how fond
of them he always was! I will have them everywhere about
the house on Christmas Day. There shall be no other
guests except Mr. Felton; I will coax papa to let me have
it all my own way for once, and I will try and make Earle
forget.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus day by day she thought of him and planned for his
comfort and happiness. The days grew longer and longer
to her as the time drew nearer, until she became so restless,
nervous and impatient, that her appetite failed, and all
her interest in other things waned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The week before Christmas she sought her lawyer, and
had a long talk with him regarding her uncle’s strange
bequest.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the first he had heard of it, for she had been loth
to say much about it, knowing her father’s bitter opposition.
But it could be put off no longer, and she hoped Mr. Dalton
would be ashamed to refuse his signature when the paper
should be presented by the lawyer; and though Mr. Felton
was somewhat surprised at the information, yet his admiration
for the fair girl increased fourfold as he observed how
heartily she appeared to second Mr. Forrester’s wishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will make out the papers with pleasure, Miss Editha,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>he said; “you want them for Christmas Day—they shall be
ready, and a fine gift it will be for the young man. Poor
fellow! I always felt sorry for him, he was such a promising
chap; and I’m glad he’s going to have something to
start with—he’ll need it bad enough with every man’s hand
against him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; but I believe Mr. Wayne will live down his
misfortune and command the respect of every one who ever
knew him,” said Editha flushing.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not like to hear Earle pitied in that way, as if
he had fallen into sudden temptation and was guilty; she
<em>knew</em> he was innocent, and she wanted everybody else to
think so, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will come and dine with us that day, will you not,
Mr. Felton? I shall invite Earle to dinner. I want to make
the day pleasant for him if I can—he is so alone in the
world, you know,” she added.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Felton searched the flushed face keenly a moment,
then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Miss Editha; I shall be happy to do so, as
I am also somewhat alone in the world—that is, if it will
be agreeable to all parties. Have you talked this matter
over with Mr. Dalton? Does he approve of the measures
you are taking?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s face clouded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” she answered, reluctantly; “papa does not approve
of my giving Mr. Wayne the money; but, of course, it must
be done. It was Uncle Richard’s wish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahem! Excuse me, Miss Editha, but how old are you?”
Mr. Felton asked, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was twenty the twentieth of November, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you will not be of age until the twentieth of <em>next</em>
November. I am sorry to disappoint you; but since this
bequest was not included in the will of Mr. Forrester, and
you are under age, you can convey no property to any one
without Mr. Dalton’s sanction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s face was very sad and perplexed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So papa told me himself,” she sighed. “Is there <em>no</em> way,
Mr. Felton, that I can give Earle this money without his
signing the papers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid not. He is your natural guardian, and
everything will have to be submitted to his approval, at least
until the twentieth of next November, nearly a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Uncle Richard made me promise that I would give
it to Mr. Wayne just as soon as his time expired, and <em>I must
do it</em>,” Editha said, almost in tears.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>She had hoped that Mr. Felton could find a way to help
her out of this trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The law is a hard master sometimes,” he said, sympathizing
with her evident distress; “but I will make out the
papers as you desire, and perhaps we can advise and prevail
upon your father to do what is right on Christmas
Day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you do think it is right Earle should have this
money?” she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, if it was Mr. Forrester’s wish, since the money
was his own to do with as he chose; but I am sorry he was
not able to add a codicil to his will. It would have saved
all this trouble, for no one could have gainsaid that. Do
not be discouraged, however; we may be able to persuade
Mr. Dalton to see things as we do. You shall have the papers
by the twenty-fifth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been thinking,” Editha said, musingly, “that if
you could have it before, and we could get papa to sign it,
it might save some unpleasant feelings. If we should wait
until Christmas Day, and he should refuse before Earle, it
might make him very uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps that would be the better way, and I will attend
to it for you as soon as possible,” Mr. Felton assented.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha went home in rather a doubtful frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will Earle do if papa will not consent?” she murmured,
the tears chasing each other down her cheeks. “He
will not have any money, and, with no one to hold out a
helping hand, he will become disheartened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A clear case of love!” Mr. Felton said, thoughtfully,
upon Edith’s departure. “It’s too bad, too, for, of course
it would never do for her to marry him, with the stigma
upon his character. Poor fellow! he’ll have a hard time
of it if Dalton won’t give in, for people are mighty shy of
jail-birds, be they ever so promising; and her father,
according to my way of thinking, loves money too well to
give up a pretty sum like ten thousand.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='large'>“THAT IS MY ULTIMATUM”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The twenty-third of December arrived, and Earle Wayne
was a free man once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who can portray his feelings as, once more clad in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>habiliments of a citizen—his prison garb, like the chrysalis
of the grub, having dropped from him forever—he came
forth into the world and sought the haunts of men? No
one can do justice to them; such feelings are indescribable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne was not twenty-three years old.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was tall, broad-shouldered, and stalwart of form.</p>

<p class='c007'>His face was the face of nature’s nobleman; a clear,
dark skin, eyes of deep hazel, with hair of just a darker
shade crowning a forehead broad, full, and at every point
well developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>His nose was somewhat large, and of the Roman type;
his mouth sweet and gentle in expression, but full of manly
strength and firmness; it had also now something of sadness
in its lines, from the long term of cruel endurance
and restraint which he had undergone.</p>

<p class='c007'>But his step was as free and proud, his head as erect, his
gaze as clear and unflinching as before any one had dared to
accuse him of having robbed his fellow-man, or he had
served a criminal’s sentence.</p>

<p class='c007'>And why not?</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not sinned; he had done no wrong; he had never
wilfully harmed a human being in all his life. His own
conscience told him he was as true and noble a man at
heart as any that walked the earth; and he would not sacrifice
his self-respect because, upon circumstantial evidence,
he had been obliged to serve out a sentence in a State prison
for another man’s crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>He returned to the city that had been his home before his
imprisonment, and where he had served three pleasant years
with Richard Forrester, and where now, since he was dead
and gone, he had no hope of having a friendly hand extended
to him. His first night he spent in a quiet, but
respectable hotel, and slept restfully and well.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning Mr. Felton wended his way, with the
all-important document which Editha desired in his pocket,
to Mr. Dalton’s residence on ——th street.</p>

<p class='c007'>He meant to have attended to it before, but had been
unexpectedly called from town on business the morning
after Editha’s visit to him, and had had no time until then
to go to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was in a fever of anxiety and impatience on account
of it, and for two whole days had watched for his
coming from her window almost incessantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at last she saw him ascending the steps, she sped
to the door and answered his ring, whereupon she led him
directly to the library, where her father was sitting.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Papa,” she said, speaking as indifferently as she could,
after the two men had exchanged greetings, “Mr. Felton
has called to-day to settle that business of Uncle Richard’s
bequest to Mr. Wayne.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton started and flushed angrily, frowning darkly
upon her; then by an effort curbing his anger, he turned
to the lawyer with a light laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has this young lady been importuning you also upon her
sentimental whims?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Editha called several days ago and told me of her
uncle’s request, and asked me to prepare the necessary documents,”
Mr. Felton replied, quietly, and with a sympathetic
glance at Editha’s hot cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think of it? Did you ever hear of
such a piece of foolishness as she contemplates?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a question with me whether it <em>is</em> a piece of foolishness
to desire to fulfill the request of a dying man,” returned
the lawyer, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha gave him a grateful look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw! Richard Forrester did not know what he was
about. He was a feeble paralytic, and not accountable
for what he said at that time,” said Mr. Dalton, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, papa! how can you say that, when you know that his
mind was perfectly clear?” Editha exclaimed, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you invite Mr. Felton here to-day to argue this point
with me?” he demanded sharply of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I asked him, as he has stated, to prepare the necessary
papers to settle this money upon Mr. Wayne, hoping that
he might convince you that it is best to allow me to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know Earle’s time expired yesterday, and I am
expecting him every moment,” Editha said, with some
agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>You are expecting him every moment!</em>” repeated Mr.
Dalton, growing excited also, though in a different way, and
from a different cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not forgotten the night that he had stolen into
her library and tampered with the package committed to her
care, nor what secrets that package contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; I wrote to him to come directly here as soon
as he was free.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, pray, did you tell him what he was to come for?”
thundered Mr. Dalton, in a rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told him I had a message for him, and also a package
belonging to him,” Editha said, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was growing more calm as he became excited.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Did you ever hear of such folly?” he asked of Mr. Felton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think Miss Dalton is perfectly right in wishing to carry
out her uncle’s desires. She will have a large fortune left,
even after giving up the ten thousand, and my advice to
you would be to put no obstacle in her path. Of course,
I know she cannot do this without your consent—at least,
not at present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course not; and I shall not allow it. I am surprised
that a man of your prudence and judgment should advise
such a thing,” Mr. Dalton answered with some heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I simply believe in doing as we would be done by. Put
yourself in young Wayne’s place Mr. Dalton and consider
whether a little friendly help from the dead friend who was
always so kind to him would not be very acceptable just at
this time,” Mr. Felton answered earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>A dark flush mounted to Mr. Dalton’s brow at these
words. Put himself in Earle Wayne’s—<em>her son’s</em>—place!
Imagine him to be in the position of the man he had such
cause to hate! The thought stirred all the bad blood in his
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He shall never have <em>one penny</em> of my daughter’s fortune.
I will never put my name to any paper like what you have
brought here to-day!” he cried angrily and smiting the table
near which he sat heavily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa let me plead with you,” Editha said gently beseechingly.
“I <em>promised</em> to do this thing at this time. Please
do not make me break my word; for <em>my</em> sake let me do as
Uncle Richard wished; do not force me to do a <em>worse</em> thing
than that for which Earle was so cruelly sentenced!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I force you to commit no robbery! Girl, what do you
mean? I am preventing you from robbing yourself!” he
cried, angrily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so, Mr. Dalton,” Mr. Felton said, with dignity; for he
longed to pommel the man for speaking so to the beautiful
girl before him. “I can appreciate Miss Editha’s feelings;
she not only wishes to befriend this unfortunate young man
on her own account, but she believes that after to-day the
ten thousand dollars are no longer hers. Richard Forrester
gave the sum from his own property before it became hers,
to young Wayne, and, if you refuse to allow her to settle it
upon him, <em>you</em> are not only committing a wrong, but forcing
her to commit one also.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I understand that you two are trying to make me out
a thief?” demanded Mr. Dalton, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is an ugly word; but, morally speaking, I should say
it was the right one to use in this case; legally, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>since there was no codicil to the will, I suppose Miss Dalton
is entitled to everything,” Mr. Felton observed, dryly, with
a scornful curve of his lip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton for a moment was too enraged to reply; then
he burst forth:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will see him in —— before he shall ever touch a penny
of her money! That is my ultimatum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Felton, upon this, turned to Editha, who was standing,
very pale, by the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her father’s anger and words had shocked her beyond
expression; but they had also aroused some of the reserve
force of her character.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that case, Miss Editha, my services are not needed
here to-day. I suppose I shall destroy the document I
have prepared?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>No, sir!</em> Keep it if you please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep it! What for, pray?” demanded her father, with a
sneer.</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned to him very quietly, but with a mien which
he was learning to dread, and said, in low, firm tones:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be twenty-one, sir, in a little less than a year, and,
according to the law of the land, my own mistress. I shall
not then need to obtain the consent of any one in order to do
as I like with my money. On the twentieth of November
next Earle Wayne will receive his ten thousand dollars, <em>with
a year’s interest added</em>. That is the best I can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, without waiting for Mr. Dalton to reply, and wholly
ignoring his dark looks, she turned to Mr. Felton, with one
of her charming smiles, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will drop our business for to-day; and, as there is the
lunch-bell, won’t you come out and try the merits of a cup
of coffee and a plate of chicken salad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lawyer regarded her with a gleam of admiration in
his fine old eyes; he had not thought she possessed so much
character.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I thank you,” he replied, thinking it best to get out
of the tempest as soon as practicable. “You know it is the
day before Christmas, and that is usually a busy time; besides,
I have another engagement in half an hour, and there
is barely time to reach my office. You will also excuse me
for to-morrow,” he added, in a lower tone; and Editha knew
that, after what had occurred to-day, it would be no pleasure
to him to dine with them, as she had asked him to do. She
knew, too, that her little plan regarding making a pleasant
day for Earle was blighted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>He bowed coldly to Mr. Dalton, and Editha followed him
to the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not worry over what you cannot help, Miss Editha;
eleven months won’t be so very long to wait, and, meanwhile,
if you will send young Wayne to me, I think I can
put him in a way to keep his head above water until that
time,” he said, kindly, as he shook her hand in farewell at
the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha thanked him, with tears in her eyes, and then
would have sought her own rooms, but she heard her father
calling her, and so she returned to the library, though she
dreaded another scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A fine spectacle you have made of yourself to-day,” were
the sneering, angry words which greeted her entrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>She walked quietly to where he sat, and stood before him;
but two very bright spots now relieved her unusual paleness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you wish anything particular of me, papa? If not,
I think it would be better not to keep lunch waiting any
longer,” she said gently, though with an evident effort at
self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I want anything of you? I would like to give you a
wholesome shaking for what you have done to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She lifted her head, and encountered his two blazing,
angry eyes, her own glance clear, steadfast, and unflinching.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a wilful little—fool!” he said, nettled by her
calm demeanor, and almost beside himself with rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still she said nothing, and he instantly grew ashamed
of those last words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have no idea how angry you have made me to-day,”
he said, half apologetically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no desire to make you angry, sir. I only desire
and <em>intend</em> to do right,” she answered, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Intend! Is that a threat?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir—merely a statement of a fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And refers to what you said just before Mr. Felton went
out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Edith Dalton, if you dare to defy me in this thing, I’ll
make your life so miserable that you will wish you were
dead,” he said, in concentrated tones of passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>She paled again at the fearful words, and a keen pain
smote her heart that her own father should speak thus to
her; then she replied, steadily:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no wish to defy you, sir, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you will not obey me—you would set my authority
aside if you could,” he interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“I acknowledge your authority as the highest of any
on earth, and I will yield you cheerful obedience in all that
is right—beyond that I cannot go, I <em>will</em> not go. I have
reached an age where I am capable of judging for myself
upon all moral questions, and I must exercise that judgment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a point of business, upon which you set aside my
wishes and my authority,” he said, moodily, and his eyes
wavering uneasily beneath her steady gaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It involves the principles of right and wrong also. I
promised that Earle Wayne should have this money, and if
you will not let me give it to him now, I shall pay it to him,
as I said, a year from now, with interest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew she meant it, and, in his passion, he half raised
his clenched hand as if to strike her.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the soft blue eyes, with the keen pain in them, disarmed
him, and it dropped heavily back upon the arm of
his chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, papa,” she said, her voice full of unshed tears,
“why need we disagree upon so slight a thing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you call a matter involving ten thousand dollars a
slight thing?” he asked, with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, in comparison with what will remain, my father,”
laying her hand softly on his shoulder and pleading in tones
that ought to have melted a harder heart. “Let us do what
is right; let us be friends and united in heart, instead of
growing so widely apart as we have been during the past
year or two.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will not yield to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In all that is right, I shall be only too glad to,” she
answered, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you persist in giving this money to that——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>I must.</em> That is settled,” she interrupted, firmly, and to
prevent the utterance of some obnoxious word, she knew
not what.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never—<em>never!</em> Do you think I would let you give it to
him—<em>him</em> of all others in the world?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Edith regarded him in surprise at these excited words.
They seemed to imply a deadly hatred for which she could
not account, knowing that Earle had never done her father
any injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A thief—a robber—a criminal!” he added, noticing her
look, and having no desire to have her inquire into the real
nature of his hatred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle never was either of those,” she said, proudly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No matter; he has suffered the disgrace of them all, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>there can be no peace between you and me until you promise
to yield to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot in this instance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the consequences be upon your own head. I’ll try
and have patience with you until the year is out; then, if
you defy me, I’ll make you rue it. Go!” and he pointed
impatiently toward the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without a word, Editha glided from the room, her heart
heavy and sore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after she heard him leave the house, and ten minutes
later there came a ring at the door that, spite of her pain,
sent the rosy blood leaping to her very brow, in a burning
tide, and made her heart leap like a frightened bird in her
bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle has come,” she murmured, as she sat listening for
the servant to come to summon her, and trying to still her
throbbing nerves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='large'>“MY LIFE SHALL BE FOURSQUARE”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The servant who answered the ring at Mr. Dalton’s door
found standing there a tall, dignified young man, with the
unmistakable stamp of the gentleman upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his inquiry if Miss Dalton was at home, he replied
that she was, and ushered him into a small reception-room
opposite the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take this, if you please, to her,” Earle Wayne said,
handing the man a blank, unsealed envelope.</p>

<p class='c007'>The servant took it with a bow and withdrew, wondering
what that spotless envelope contained, and who the gentleman
was who sent no card—unless, perhaps, it might be in
the envelope, and was intended for Edith’s eyes alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fair girl arose with apparent calmness at his rap, and,
taking the missive from his hand, opened it, and found
within her own note, that she had written bidding Earle
come to her as soon as he should be free.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment she realized how very short and formal
it was, and a feeling of remorse stole into her heart that
she had not written more freely and kindly, in spite of her
sensitiveness at her father’s sneers and insinuations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Waiting a moment or two to cool the hot color in her
cheeks, and to still the fierce beating of her heart, she then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>went slowly and trembling down to meet the brave hero,
whom she had not seen for nearly three years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would he be much changed? Would he be pale, haggard,
and miserable in appearance? Would he look the same, and
speak the same, as he had done on that sad day when she
had bidden him farewell and left him to go to his dreary
fate within those four gloomy walls, or would he be broken
and disheartened, and feel that the future held nothing but
scorn and contempt for him?</p>

<p class='c007'>She had read of men, noble, spirited, and energetic, who,
having been imprisoned for a term of years, were ruined
by it, and who had settled down into an existence of profound
melancholy and inaction upon regaining their freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would Earle be like this?</p>

<p class='c007'>These were some of the anxious questions which flitted
through her mind on the way from her chamber to the
reception-room, where Earle, with equal agitation, was
awaiting her coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>She opened the door softly and went in.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not hear her—he was standing at a window, his
back toward her, and absorbed in thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>As if shod with velvet, Editha crossed the room and stood
at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes had lighted wondrously as they rested upon the
proud, handsome figure before her, and the rich color coming
and going in her cheeks made her marvelously beautiful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, I am so glad you have come,” she said, simply,
yet with tremulous tones that betrayed her gladness was
almost unto tears, while with something of her old impulse
she held out both fair hands to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He started and turned quickly at the sweet tones, and
searched the glowing face with eager scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could this tall, beautiful woman, with the shining, silken
crown about her shapely head, with her deep, glowing eyes,
her rich, varying color, her cordial, tremulous greeting, be
the same Editha of three years ago?</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been a fair, plump, and laughing girl, her sunny
hair falling in graceful waves over her rounded shoulders,
her eyes dancing with fun and merriment, her moods never
twice the same, a creature of heart and impulse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now her form was grown; she was more fully developed,
with a stately poise which she was not wont to have; her
features were more deeply lined with character, and glorified
with a richer, more mature beauty, and the waving, sunny
hair had been gathered up and wreathed her head in a
plaited golden coronet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>But these eyes—those clear, truthful, heaven-blue eyes
were the same; the smile was the same upon the scarlet
lips, and the sweet, tender tremulous tones were the same;
he had never forgotten their music, and his heart bounded
with a joy that was almost pain as they again fell upon his
ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, I am so glad you have come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Words so simple, yet full of heartfelt gladness, never
greeted mortal ears before.</p>

<p class='c007'>He grasped both her outstretched hands, forgetting all
her supposed neglect of him, and without the least hesitation
as to his own worthiness to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew he was worthy—his hands, morally speaking,
were as fair and free from stain as her own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet he had not expected to find her so cordial and glad
to see him, and her manner filled him with deepest gratitude
and admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha—Miss Dalton,” he said, his whole face glowing,
“I thank you for your words of welcome—I cannot doubt
their heartiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course not; why should you, Earle?” she asked, with
some surprise, as she searched his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you that I should not forget you—that I should
always be your friend; what reason could you have to think
I would not greet you heartily?” she urged, a little look
of grieved surprise in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should not if—if—pardon me, I ought not to speak
thus. Have you been well?” and he tried to change the
subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite well; and you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not my looks speak for me?” he asked, smiling, yet
with the shadow deepening in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>He might be well physically, but it would take a long
while to heal the wound in his soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle,” Editha said, gravely, meeting his eyes with a
steady, earnest look, “what made you speak as you did about
doubting the heartiness of my welcome? I can see that
you have some reason for it; please tell me—surely you
did not think I would have broken my promise—my flowers
must have proven that I did not forget.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle gave her a quick, surprised glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was just why I was in doubt,” he said, flushing
slightly. “I have not received a single token of remembrance
from you for nearly two years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha instantly grew crimson to the line of gold above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>her forehead, then white as the delicate lace at her throat
at this startling intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>What could this strange thing mean? Who could have
appropriated her flowers and kept them from him?</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a feeling of shame, not unmixed with indignation,
her heart told her that her <em>father</em>, in his prejudice
against Earle, must have intercepted them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How cruel!” she murmured. “I do not wonder that
you doubted my friendship; but, to exonerate myself, I must
tell you that every week I have sent you flowers, or fruit, or
<em>something</em>, to show you that you were remembered—not
once have I failed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then forgive me for all the hard things I have thought,”
he said, in tones of self-reproach. “I can never tell you
how those sweet little messages cheered me during my first
year in—that place, nor how dreary and lonely I was when
they came no longer to brighten my gloomy cell. After Mr.
Forrester died,” he continued, with emotion, “I felt as if
my only friend had been taken from me. I had not one to
whom to turn for a ray of comfort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” Editha said, with starting tears, then, with
rising color, “if you had only dropped me a line, I would
have taken care that my offerings reached you safely after
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know the old saying, ‘one may as well be neglected
as forgotten;’ I never mistrusted that they had been sent
and failed to reach their destination, and so imagined a
good many things I had no right to, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And were too proud to remind me of my negligence,”
Editha interrupted, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doubtless some enemy has done this, or they could not <em>all</em>
have missed coming to me. Am I forgiven for doubting
my stanch little friend?” he asked, gently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Freely; I could not blame you under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then let us talk of something else,” Earle said for he
began to mistrust from Editha’s manner <em>who</em> had been the
guilty one. “Tell me of Mr. Forrester and of yourself during
these years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And thus their conversation drifted to other subjects,
and, as they conversed, their old freedom of manner returned
in a measure—in a measure, I repeat, for there could
not be quite the former carelessness and sparkle, while each
was trying to conceal the secret which their hearts held,
and which, for the time, at least, they felt they must not
reveal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle told her of his life in prison—of how he had spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>his time—of the knowledge he had acquired, and something
of his plans for the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle,” she said, glancing up at him through the tears
she could not restrain, when he had completed his account,
“you have borne it so nobly, this suffering for another, that
I want to tell you how proud I am of you; and Uncle Richard
would say the same thing if he were living.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” he said, with emotion; “it is almost worth
having been a prisoner for three years to hear you say
that. If only the world might feel as assured of my innocence
as you do, and hold out the same friendly hand of
welcome,” he concluded, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will in time, Earle—I feel sure that some day your
innocence will be established.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall devote my energies to that purpose, and if the
guilty ones are never brought to justice, I will <em>live</em> my innocence.
I will prove it by my life—my life shall be <em>foursquare</em>,
and I will yet command the faith and respect of all
who know me. It will be hard, but I shall strive to fight
my battle bravely, and I feel that I shall conquer in the
end. You know Pope tells us that ‘He’s armed <em>without</em>
that’s innocent <em>within</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <em>will</em> succeed—you cannot fail with such an earnest
purpose in your heart,” Editha said, eagerly; then she added,
musingly: “You said you would make your life ‘foursquare.’
I do not think I quite understand that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne smiled a rare, sweet smile, as, leaning nearer
his fair companion, he said, in a low, reverent tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have read of the ‘city that lieth foursquare,’ whose
length is as large as it breadth, whose ‘walls are of jasper,’
and whose ‘gates are of pearl.’ That city, Editha, a perfect
square, and embellished with the most precious stones, is, I
believe, the emblem or symbol of a pure and perfect life,
and so, with the help of God, I mean that mine shall be
‘foursquare.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha gave him a look as if she thought it could not
be far from that even now.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a moment of silence he continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“From my early boyhood I have always had a desire to
become a thoroughly good man—a man honored and respected
by my fellow-men. My mother ever tried to impress
me never to be guilty of a mean or ignoble action. I thought
her the perfection of womanhood while she lived, and have
tried to treasure her precepts since she died; so you can
judge something of what I have endured in the disgrace
of serving out a criminal’s sentence. I could not speak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>this to any one else,” he added, with some excitement; “but
you have been so kind and sympathizing that it relieves my
burden somewhat to speak of it to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha did not reply—she had no words with which to
answer him; but she lifted her blue eyes to his face, and
he saw that they were full of tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad,” Earle went on, a slight tremulousness in his
tones, “that my mother did not live to know of my deep
trouble—much as I have needed her sympathy, love, and
counsel—for she must have suffered torture on account of
it. If she knows anything about it now, she knows that
I am innocent, and also just why this sad experience was
permitted to come to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, how deeply you have suffered from it,” Editha
said, almost awed by the intensity of his feeling, and wondering,
too, at his way of looking at the past, as if in some
way his trial was meant for his ultimate good.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I will rise above it yet; it may be hard for me to
battle against the frowns and distrust of the world for
awhile, but I sail not allow them to dishearten me—if only
I had a few more friends,” he added, wistfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You cannot long be without them, with such nobility
and resolution in your soul,” Editha answered, her face
glowing with admiration for him, “and you may count me
the warmest of them all until you find a better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She involuntarily held out her hand as if to seal the compact
as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>He grasped it eagerly, his whole face luminous with sudden
joy; his breath came quickly, his broad breast rose and
fell, his eyes sought hers with an intensity of expression
that made her vail them with her white lids.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not know how she was tempting him—she could
not know how he had grown to love her during the past
six years, and how sweet and cheering her sympathy was
to him just now, when he felt himself so friendless and
alone in the great cold world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God bless you, Editha! If—I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had begun to speak in low, concentrated tones, but
now he stopped short, as if some great inward shock had
suddenly cut off his power of speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>He shut his teeth tightly together and drew in his breath
with a quick gasp; the great veins in his forehead filled and
stood out full and purple, and his hands locked themselves
together with the intensity of some deep, inward emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>One quick, searching look Edith flashed up at him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>then her eyes fell again, a rosy flush rising to her very brow
at what she had seen on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” he said at length, nervously pushing
back the hair from his brow; “I fear you will think me very
thoughtless and selfish to weary you thus with my troubles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Earle, I—am <em>glad</em> that you think me worthy of your
confidence,” she answered, softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>How exceedingly beautiful she was, sitting there with her
downcast eyes, the lovely color in her face, and the womanly
sympathy beaming in every feature.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Worthy!” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, worthy,” she said, her lips relaxing just a trifle into
a tremulous smile. “I would like to be your friend in all
your troubles—maybe I could help you if you would trust
me enough to tell me of them. I used to think there was
no one like you when I was a wild and impulsive girl, and
you were with Uncle Richard—you were always so upright
so strong, and self-reliant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <em>used</em> to think that of me, Editha?” he said, flushing
again and trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>If she had known how her words moved him—but she did
not dream of his love for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to grow dizzy with the new, delicious hope that
seized him as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could it be that this fair girl had learned to love him?</p>

<p class='c007'>He had thought of her night and day, at his work and
in his lonely cell, and her image would be stamped indelibly
on his heart as long as he should live.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he had no right to speak one word of it to her now—his
disgrace clung to him, and would clog him, perhaps, for
long years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh! if he could but break the cruel fetters that bound
him—if he could but discover the real criminal, and clear
his own name, then he might hope to win the respect of the
world once more, fame and position, and the right to tell
this gentle girl how dear she was to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she returned, noticing his emphasis, and fearing
she might have wounded him by wording her sentence thus;
“and, Earle. I think you are very—very noble now, to bear
your trouble so patiently and uncomplainingly, and something
tells me that it will not be so very long before all the
world will be proud to call you friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She spoke softly, but in a tone that thrilled him through
and through.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The words came breathlessly, and before he could stop
them. They would not be stayed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bent eagerly toward her, his heart in his eyes, his
face full of passion which so nearly mastered him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he checked them, biting them off short as he had done
before, but growing white even to his lips with the effort it
cost him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something in his tones made her start and look up, and
she read it all as in an open book—all his love for her, all
the blighted hopes of the past, the longing and bitterness
of the present, wherein he writhed beneath the stigma resting
upon him, and the mighty self-control which would not
presume upon her sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>A flood of crimson suddenly dyed her face and throat, and
even the soft, white hands which lay in her lap, and which
were now seized with nervous trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then a look of resolution gleamed in her eyes, the red
lips settled into an expression of firmness, and, though her
heart beat like the frightened thing it was, her sweet tones
did not falter as she replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then—<em>Editha Dalton will be very proud also</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Was ever heaven’s music sweeter than those few low-spoken,
unfaltering words?</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no mistaking them—they had been uttered with
a purpose, and he knew that his love was returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eager brown eyes looked into tender blue for one long,
delicious minute. No word was spoken, but both knew
that for all time they belonged to each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Earle Wayne, with a glad, though solemn light
illumining his face, lifted the white hand that lay nearest
him, touched it reverently with his lips, and then gently laid
it back in its place.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was as though he blessed her for the hope thus delicately
held out to him, but his innate nobility and self-respect
would not allow him to bind her to him by so much as a
word until he could stand proudly before her and offer her
a name that should not have so much as the shadow of a
stain upon it.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Words were never more applicable than these to those undeclared
lovers, sitting in such a mute happiness side by side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>in the little reception-room, on that bright morning so near
Christmastide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was the first to break the spell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not told you Uncle Richard’s message yet,” she
said, and an expression of anxiety for the moment chased
the radiant look from her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“True—it was like his kindness to remember me,” Earle
returned, a shadow stealing over his fine face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He thought a great deal of you, and had great hopes for
your future——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which, if it amounts to anything, will be in a great measure
owing to his goodness,” he interrupted, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Uncle Richard was a true, good man; but, Earle,
now I have something unpleasant to tell you. I—he left you
a <em>token</em> of his remembrance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She hesitated, and he said, with a smile:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sure there is nothing unpleasant about that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but wait,” she began, in some confusion and hardly
knowing how to go on with her disagreeable task; “he left
you a little money, ten thousand dollars, to give you a start
in life, he said.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne startled and flushed deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did Mr. Forrester do that?” he asked, greatly moved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and now comes the disagreeable part of it all. I
do not like to tell you, but I must,” she said, lifting her
crimson, troubled face to him, and he wondered what there
was about it that should make her appear so. “Papa did
not like it very well,” she went on, dropping her eyes with a
feeling of shame. “He thought that it was not right the
money should go to a stranger, and—and—oh! Earle, I know
it seems selfish and cruel, but he says you cannot have it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha nearly broke down here; it had required all her
courage to tell him this; and now she sat still, covered with
shame and confusion. A shade of bitterness passed over the
young man’s face at her last words, and then the least smile
of scorn curled his fine lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had never experienced very much respect for Sumner
Dalton; he knew him to be a man devoid of principle,
of small mind, and smaller soul; but he was Editha’s father,
and he could speak no word against him. He saw how
ashamed and uncomfortable she felt to be obliged to make
this humiliating confession regarding her only parent, while
he admired the fine sense of honor that would not allow
her to shrink from her duty in telling him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to tell you just how the matter stands,” she
resumed presently: “and then you must excuse papa as best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>you can. You doubtless have heard that Uncle Richard was
paralyzed—he had no use of either his hands or his feet, and
was entirely helpless, although his mind was clear until just
before his second shock, which came suddenly in the night.
He told me the day before that he knew he could not live,
and gave me directions just what to do. He said if he could
only use his hands, he would have added a codicil to his
will in your favor, but as it was, I must attend to his wishes.
He said it—the will—had been made many years ago, giving
everything to me; but ever since he became interested in you
he had intended doing something handsome for you; if he
had lived and you wished it, he would have wanted you to
go back to him as a partner in his business, as soon as you
should be free to do so. But he charged me—<em>made me
promise</em>—to make over to you ten thousand dollars as soon
as your time expired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He left a large fortune, more than I shall ever know what
to do with, and I was <em>so glad</em> of this bequest to you,” Editha
went on, heartily. “I asked Mr. Felton to see that everything
was done properly, so that you could have the money
at once. He did so, and I wanted you to have it as a sort
of Christmas gift; but, Earle, I am not twenty-one yet; papa
is still my natural guardian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” Earle said, encouragingly, as she stopped in distress,
and he pitied her for having to make this confession
to him, while a tender smile wreathed his lips at her truthfulness
and her sorrow on his account.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So there is no way—you will have to wait a little while
for your money. I shall be twenty-one the twentieth of next
November, and my own mistress; and, Earle, you shall have
it then, with the year’s interest added.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He nearly laughed to see how eager she was for him to
have exactly his due; then he grew suddenly grave, and
said, gently but firmly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Editha, I do not wish, I cannot take <em>one dollar</em> of this
money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it was Uncle Richard’s dying wish and bequest to
you—it <em>belongs</em> to you by <em>right</em>,” she pleaded, bitterly disappointed
by his refusal to take it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, by your uncle’s will, which he did not any way
change, it all belongs to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he would have changed the will if he could have
held a pen; he said so; and the money is not mine,” she
cried, almost in tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The law would judge differently—your father is right.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>It should not come to me”—this was said with a touch of
bitterness, however—“and I will not have one dollar of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Supposing that you were in my place just now, and I
in yours, would you claim that it all belonged to you?” she
asked, lifting her searching glance to his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he said; “but the difference in our positions, because
I am <em>not</em> in your place and you in mine, alters the case
altogether.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot agree with you; and you would have considered
me mean and dishonorable if I had taken advantage of the
will and claimed the whole, would you not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you did not; you have done your duty, and consequently
have nothing to regret,” Earle replied, evasively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you did not answer my question,” Editha persisted;
“would you think that I had done right if I had not wished
to give you this money and withheld it from you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“N-o,” he admitted, reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, morally speaking, it does not belong to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The will gave you everything——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is not the question,” she interrupted. “If you were
pleading the case for some one else, you would claim that
the money did not belong to me, and that, morally speaking,
I had no right whatever to it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, you should be a lawyer yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a side issue; as they say in court, stick to the
point, if you please,” she again interrupted; “have I not
stated the truth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am obliged to confess that you have; but, Editha, I
do not want the money, though I am very grateful to Mr.
Forrester for his kindness in remembering me, and to you
for wishing to carry out his wishes so faithfully.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, Earle, take it; I <em>want</em> you to have it, and I wish
to do just as he told me to do; you will wound me deeply
if you refuse it,” she urged.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a very sweet, earnest face that looked up into his,
and, had she pleaded for almost anything else, Earle would
have found it impossible to resist her. His own face grew
grave, almost sorrowful, as he returned:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would not cause you a moment’s unnecessary pain,
Editha, but I must be firm in this decision. Forgive me
if I wound you; but, on the whole, I am glad that Mr. Dalton
win a name and position entirely by my own merits. By my
own strong arm will I carve out my future and win my way
in the world; by my own indomitable will and energy, with
the help of a greater than I, I will rise to honor, and <em>not</em>
upon the foundation that another has built,” he concluded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>with an earnestness and solemnity that made Editha’s heart
thrill with pride and the conviction of his ultimate success.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very brave,” she said, with admiring but still
wistful eyes. “But suppose Uncle Richard <em>had</em> added a
codicil to his will in your favor, what then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A smile of amusement curled his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I suppose the wheels of my car of ambition would
have been unavoidably clogged with this fortune. It would
not then have been optional with me whether I would have
it or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It shall not be now; the money is not mine—I <em>will not</em>
keep it. I should be as bad as those wretches who robbed
us, and then left you to suffer for their crime,” Editha exclaimed,
passionately, and almost in despair at his obstinacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not see how you can do otherwise than keep it;
every one will tell you that it is legally yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is many a moral wrong perpetuated under the
cloak of ‘legality,’” she began, somewhat sarcastically, then
continued, more earnestly: “My proud, self-willed knight,
whose watchwords are truth and honor, whose life is to be
‘foursquare,’ do you think there are no others whose natures
are reaching out after the same heights? There <em>are</em> others,
Earle,” she said, more softly, with glowing cheeks and
drooping lids, “who look with longing eyes toward the ‘jasper
walls,’ and ‘gates of pearl;’ and can one be ‘true and
honorable’ and keep what does not belong to one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can I convince you, Editha, that I <em>cannot</em> take
this money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what <em>will</em> you do, Earle? How will you begin
life again?” she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a little, enough for that, laid by; and now,
with three years’ interest added, it will be sufficient to give
me a start, and I shall do very well. Do not allow my
refusal to comply with your wishes to disturb you. Try to
imagine that if Mr. Forrester had never known me he
would never have thought of making a change in the disposition
of his property,” Earle concluded, lightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the <em>if</em> exists, nevertheless. He <em>did</em> make the change;
and, once for all, I will not have my conscience burdened
with what is not my own. Earle, on the twentieth of next
November I shall deposit in the First National Bank of this
city ten thousand dollars, with a year’s interest, to your
credit,” she asserted, resolutely. “Meanwhile,” she added,
“Mr. Felton told me to say to you that he thought he could
arrange some way for you to keep your head above board,
if you will go to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“I thank Mr. Felton, but I think the term ‘self-willed’ may
be applied to some one else besides myself,” Earle answered,
smilingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle,” cried the lovely girl, turning suddenly upon him,
and, with something of her old girlish impulse, laying one
white hand on his, “if you won’t do as I wish for your <em>own</em>
sake, won’t you for <em>mine</em>? and”—the color mounting to her
forehead as she made the delicate offer—“until the year expires,
won’t you please go to Mr. Felton and get whatever
you need?”</p>

<p class='c007'>If Earle was ever impatient and rebellious in his life he
was at that moment at the cruel fate that kept him from
reaching out and clasping his beautiful beloved in his arms,
and telling her all the love of his great heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>How delicately she had worded her proposition! She
had not coarsely offered to give him money from her own
income, feeling that his proud spirit would recoil from
coming to her, a woman, for help; but she had made Mr.
Felton the medium through which all his needs might be
supplied until he could establish himself in business.</p>

<p class='c007'>He ventured to take that small hand and press it gratefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha,” he said, striving to control the quiver in his
tones, “to both of your requests I must repeat the inevitable
‘No;’ and for the first, I entreat you not to tempt me,
for I cannot tell you how hard it is to refuse anything you
ask me, and particularly in that way. As for the other
there will be no need, I trust, for I have enough for all
my present wants, and before that is gone I hope to be in
a way to supply all future needs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha sighed, but saw that his decision was unalterable,
and so let the matter drop for the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>They chatted for an hour on various topics, and then
Earle rose to take his leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>She longed to ask him to come again on the morrow to
dine, as she had planned, knowing how lonely he would
be when everybody else was so gay; but she knew that it
would be no pleasure for him to meet Mr. Dalton in his
present mood; but she did ask him to call whenever he
was at liberty, and she added, with one of her charming
smiles:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Richard’s books are all here; won’t you come and
avail yourself of them whenever you like?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He thanked her with a look that made her cheeks hot
again; and then she asked him to wait a moment and she
would bring him his package. She was gone scarcely three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>minutes, and then came back with it in one hand, and the
loveliest little bouquet imaginable in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was composed of stiff holly leaves, with their glossy
sheen and bright winter berries, clear and red, and vivid in
their contrast. It was as lovely a bit of floral handicraft
as Earle had ever seen, and his eyes lighted admiringly as
they rested on it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is for you, Earle,” Editha said, simply, seeing his
look, and handing it to him. “I made it for you this morning,
hoping you would come to-day. You will not expect
me to wish you a ‘merry Christmas;’ but,” in low, sweet
tones, “I will say instead, ‘<em>Peace</em>, good-will toward men.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was too deeply moved to reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood looking down upon the glossy red and green,
a mist gathering over his eyes in spite of his manhood, and
blessing her in his heart for those precious words which
told him he had been remembered before he was seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had “made it for him that morning, hoping he would
come to-day!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her white fingers had put every shining spray in its
place, and she had thought of him the while!</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh, why must he stand there with sealed lips, when he
longed to say so much?</p>

<p class='c007'>She would not mock him with the usual Christmas formula;
but what could have been sweeter or more appropriate
than the gentle, low-spoken “Peace, good-will toward men?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He slipped the package into an inside pocket, never mistrusting
that it had been tampered with, nor that its contents
had unlocked for Sumner Dalton the door to a mystery which
he had long sought to penetrate in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” he said, as he buttoned his coat, “for caring
for this; it is very precious to me; and some day I will
tell you why and show you its contents. This much I will
tell you now—had it been lost or destroyed, <em>my identity</em>
would also have been destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha looked up in surprise, but she asked no question.</p>

<p class='c007'>His <em>identity</em> destroyed! Was it possible that Sumner Dalton’s
keen eyes could have missed anything of importance
within that package?</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha accompanied him to the door, and parted from
him with a simple “good-night,” and then went quietly and
gravely to her own room. But she had sent him forth
full of courage and hope in spite of his present loneliness
and unpromising future; and that bunch of holly was the
most precious thing that the world held for him that day,
the fair giver excepted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='large'>THE ECCENTRIC CLIENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Several months passed, and bravely did Earle Wayne
battle with the world and fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cheerfully, too; for, although he did not permit himself
to see much of Editha, lest his purpose not to speak of love
should fail him, yet in his heart he knew that she loved
him, and would wait patiently until his conscience would
allow him to utter the words that should bind her to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This he felt he had no right to do until his name could
be cleared from the stain resting upon it, and he had also
gained a footing and practice in the world which would
warrant his asking the aristocratic Miss Dalton to be his
wife. It was hard, up-hill work, however, for Notwithstanding
he had passed a brilliant examination and been
admitted to the bar, yet it seemed as if some unseen force
or enemy was at work to press him down and keep him from
climbing the ladder of either fame or wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there was such an enemy!</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton hated him. He hated him for what he
had so dishonorably learned regarding him—who and what
he was—and for the relationship which he bore to that
face which he had seen in his mysterious package.</p>

<p class='c007'>He hated him for the interest which Editha manifested
in him, and also because Richard Forrester had desired
him to have a portion of his vast fortune, and the former
had dared to oppose and defy him regarding the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could never brook opposition from any one, and he
had always possessed a strange desire to be revenged upon
anybody who stood in his way in any form whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would not do for him to revenge himself directly upon
Editha, for she, with all her money, was altogether too
important a personage to him; but he knew he could do so
indirectly through Earle, and so set himself to work to crush
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, through his efforts, many a client, who would have
gladly availed themselves of the brilliant young lawyer’s
services, were influenced to go elsewhere, and their fees,
which would have been such a help to Earle in these first
dark days went to enrich the already overflowing coffers
of some more noted and “respectable” practitioner of Blackstone.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, for all this, he won for himself some practice, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>which he proved himself very successful, and not unfrequently
gained the admiration of judge, jury, and spectators
by his intelligence, shrewdness, and eloquence.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a covert sneer always followed every effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brother lawyers shrugged their shoulders and remarked,
“what a pity it was that so much talent was not better
appreciated, and that the taint upon his name must always
mar his life,” it was a “pity, too, that so fine a young man
otherwise, to all <em>outward appearance</em>, could not make a better
living; but then people were apt to be shy of employing
‘prison-birds,’ the old proverb ‘set a thief to catch a thief’
to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Sumner Dalton who had set this ball a-rolling,
and had kept it in motion until the day came when Earle
was obliged to sit from morning till night in his office, and
no one came to him for advice or counsel.</p>

<p class='c007'>He remembered what Editha had told him to do if he
had need—go to Mr. Felton and get enough for his wants;
but he was too proud to do this—he would be dependent
upon no one but himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could have gone and asked that lawyer to give him
work, as he had said he would do; but if he had recourse
to his offer, Editha would doubtless hear of it, and, thinking
him to be in need, would be made unhappy thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many a time the tempter whispered, when there was
scarcely a dollar left in his purse:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, in a few months you will have but to
reach forth your hand and pluck the golden harvest which
Richard Forrester has set apart for you, and all your trials
will be at an end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It needed but Editha’s majority and her signature to
insure him independence. But he would not yield.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will build up my own foundation, or I will not build
at all,” he would say at such times, with gloomy brow and
firmly compressed lips, but with undaunted resolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening he sat in his office more than usually depressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not had a single call during the week, and now,
as it was beginning to grow dusk, he yielded himself up to
the sad thoughts that oppressed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was beginning to storm outside, and as he looked
forth into the dismal street, a feeling of desperation and
dreariness came over him, such as he had not experienced
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>His office was excessively gloomy, for he did not indulge
much in the luxury of gas nowadays, since he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>not the wherewith to pay for it. His purse lay upon the
table before him—he had been inspecting its contents and
counting his money.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that remained to him in the world was a two-dollar
bill and some small pieces of silver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will keep me just one week longer, not counting in
any washing,” he muttered; then adding, with a grim smile:
“and a lawyer with dirty wristbands and collar is not likely to
invite many clients.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then a newsboy passed through the corridor, calling
his paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be wrecked indeed if I cannot have the daily
news,” Earle said, bitterly, as he sprang impatiently to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>He picked up a bit of silver, and, going to the door,
bought a paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming back, and, as if reckless of consequences, he
lighted the gas, turning on the full blaze, and then seating
himself comfortably in one chair and putting his feet in
another, he began to read.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarcely had he done so when he heard a shuffling step
outside in the corridor, and then there came a rap on his
door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wondering who should seek him at that hour, he arose
and opened it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short, thin-visaged, wiry man, of about fifty, stood without.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a little bob of his head, he said, in a voice as thin
as his face:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re the chap that conducted the Galgren case, ain’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; will you come in and have a seat?” Earle replied,
politely, yet with a slight smile at the way he had addressed
him, and wondering what this rather seedy personage
could desire of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man entered and sat down with his hat on, eyeing
Earle sharply the while.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ain’t doing much just now?” he said, his sharp eyes
wandering from him to his empty table, noticing the purse
with its scant contents, and then at the books undisturbed
on their shelves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, I have not been very busy this week,” Earle
quietly replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That Galgren case was a tough one, eh?” the man then
remarked, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rather a knotty problem, that is a fact,” replied Earle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>somewhat surprised at the interest the man manifested in a
case so long past.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you like another of the same sort, only a thousand
times worse?” he asked, with a keen glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want <em>work</em>, sir, let it be of what kind it may; and I
am willing to do almost <em>anything</em> in an honorable way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, I can give it to you. I’ve a knot that I
want untied that is worse than forty Gordian knots woven
into one; and if you can untie it, or even cut it asunder
for me, as Alexander did of old, and relieve me of the fix
I’m in, I think I can promise you something handsome for
your trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your statement does not sound very favorable for my
being able to do so, but I can try,” Earle replied, the look
of bitterness and anxiety beginning to fade out of his face,
while his eyes lighted with a look of keenness and eagerness
at the thought of work.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sat up in his chair with a movement full of energy,
and then added, with a smile:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me take your hat, sir; then show me this wonderful
knot of yours, and we’ll see what can be done
with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man removed his hat, and Earle saw that it was
half full of papers, letters, etc., which he turned out upon
the table, and then proceeded to unfold the case which he
wished the young lawyer to take charge of.</p>

<p class='c007'>A long conference followed; question after question was
put and answered, and every paper looked into and explained,
and the clock on the belfry-tower near by struck
the hour of midnight before Earle’s strange visitor left him,
and a handsome retaining fee as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>This he did not demand, but the man’s keen eyes had more
than once rested on that empty pocket-book lying upon the
table, and he doubtless knew that it would not come amiss.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the next four months Earle had no need to complain
of a lack of work—night and day he toiled, quietly,
steadily, persistently, a stern purpose visible in his face, a
light in his fine eyes which meant “victory,” if such a
result was possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case, which indeed proved a most perplexing one,
he felt assured would either “make or mar” his whole future;
and, if there was any such thing as winning, he was determined
to conquer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was to come to trial the first of October.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had had about four months to work it up in, and now,
on the last night of September, he sat again alone in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>office, with folded hands and weary brain, but with a smile
of satisfaction lighting up his face instead of the weary expression
of bitterness which rested there on that dreary night
when he received his first visit from the thin-visaged, wiry
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was reasonably sure of success, notwithstanding that
the opposing counsel was one of the oldest and ablest lawyers
in the city, and he was aware that if he gained the
case against him he could not fail to be looked upon with
respect for the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>It provided a tedious trial, for a whole week was occupied
in hearing the case, and as point after point, cunning and
complicated in the extreme, came up in opposition to the
prosecution, and was calmly and clearly rebutted and overthrown,
it was plainly to be seen that the tide of popular
feeling was turning in favor of the young and gifted lawyer,
and Earle felt that his weary labor of four months had
been well spent, if it gained him even this.</p>

<p class='c007'>And who shall describe the eloquence that flowed from
his lips as, with his whole heart in his work, he stood up
before the multitude and made his plea?</p>

<p class='c007'>It was clear and concise, witty and brilliant—a masterpiece
of rhetoric, logic, and conclusive evidence, combined
with a thorough knowledge of all the intricacies of the
law, and which did not fail to impress every hearer; and,
when at last he sat down, cheer after cheer arose, and a
perfect storm of applause that would not be stayed testified
to the admiration and conviction which he had excited.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a proud moment for Earle Wayne, the poor, despised
convict, and Sumner Dalton, sitting there, heard all,
and ground his teeth in fiercest rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not known of the case until almost the last, having
been again at Newport. But it had got into the papers
recently, and Earle’s name as counsel for the prosecution
had attracted his attention, and he had returned to the city
and been present during the last few days of the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something very like a sob burst from our hero’s grateful
heart at this acknowledgment of his worth and power, but
it was drowned in the din, and, though nearly every eye
was fixed upon him, they saw nothing unusual—only a very
handsome young man, who looked somewhat pale and worn
with hard work and the excitement of the week.</p>

<p class='c007'>The victory was his; the case was won, for a verdict was
rendered in favor of his client, and the men who had hitherto
shunned him and curled the lips of scorn and pity for the
“poor chap with the stigma resting on his name,” now came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>forward to shake hands and congratulate him on his victory.
His rigid course of study and discipline under Richard
Forrester’s direction spoke for itself; <em>he</em> had been a keen,
sharp-witted, successful lawyer, and his pupil bade fair to
outstrip even his brilliant achievements.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are you?” abruptly asked the wiry, thin-visaged
man, as he grasped Earle’s hand in grateful acknowledgment
after the court was dismissed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think I have changed my identity since I last
saw you, sir. I am Earle Wayne,” Earle said, with an
amused smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes; but I tell you you’ve got blue blood in your
veins. A man that can do what you have done is worth
knowing, and <em>I</em> want to know what stock you came from.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A shadow flitted across Earle’s handsome face at these
remarks, but it soon passed, and, still smiling, he returned:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I pretend to no superior attributes; I was a poor boy,
without home or friends, until Mr. Forrester took me in
and gave me the benefit of his knowledge and instruction.
I have been unfortunate also since then, as you very well
know, and when you came to me to take charge of this
case, I was well-nigh discouraged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew it—I knew it; but I knew also that the true
grit was in you. I saw it in the Galgren case, and I’ve
watched you since. Besides,” with a shrewd look up into
the handsome face, “I knew hungry dogs always work hardest
for a bone, and they seldom fail to get it, too; that’s one
reason I brought you my case, and I’m proud of the result.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, sir,” Earle said, laughing at the simile of
the hungry dog. “I am glad that your confidence was
not misplaced, and I congratulate you upon our success—it
gives you a very handsome fortune.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes; a decent bit of property, I’ll admit; but how
much of it are you going to want?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle colored at his way of putting this question; it seemed
to him a trifle surly and ungrateful after his hard work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust not more than is right, sir; but we will talk of
this another time, if you please,” he said, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little man chuckled to himself, as, slipping his arm
familiarly within Earle’s, he drew him one side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much do you want? Remember, it takes a good
deal to pay for a <em>pound of desk</em>, and you’ve lost a good
many since I came to you that night four months ago,” he
persisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle saw that the man was really kind at heart, and
meant well by him in spite of his unprepossessing manner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“And you must remember, sir, that the reputation of
this success is worth considerable to me but I suppose this
is a very unbusiness-like way to talk, and if you are in a
hurry for me to set my fee, I will do so,” and he named
a sum which he thought would pay him well for his labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little, thin-visaged, wiry man chuckled again, and
clapped Earle upon the shoulder in an approving manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very moderate and proper for a youngster, only let
me whisper a little bit of advice in your ear, albeit I’m no
lawyer. When you can find a fat customer, <em>salt a good
slice of him for yourself</em>, and when a <em>lean</em> one comes along,
don’t cut in quite so deep. How’s that for counsel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very good,” Earle said, with a hearty laugh; “but,” with
a sparkle of mischief in his eye, as it traversed the thin
form of his client from top to toe, “I’m in some doubt as
to which class you would prefer to belong to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The little man tapped his pockets significantly, and then
shoving a hand into each, drew forth two good-sized rolls
of bills and showed them to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fat, youngster, when I’ve any dealings with you, though
I can tell you I know how to <em>pinch hard</em> in the right place;”
and his wiry fingers closed over the bills in a way that reminded
Earle of miniature boa constrictors.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a strange character, and though during the trial
things had come out which seemed to make him out a miser,
harsh and soulless in all his dealings with men, yet Earle
thought there must be a spot of goodness and generosity
about him somewhere, for he seemed so appreciative of his
services. And the result proved he was right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll call around and settle to-morrow; I want this thing
off my mind; and I reckon you’ve not found many bones to
pick besides this during the last four months,” he said at
parting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir; this gigantic one has occupied all my time and
skill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spoiled any teeth?” his client asked, facetiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir; sharpened them; ready for another,” Earle responded,
in the same strain, to carry out the poor joke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll do; I would like you for a son; wish I had a
daughter—you should marry her;” and the little man, with
his characteristic bob of the head, turned and went his
way, while Earle, musing upon the events of the day returned
to his office, but thinking that if his client happened
to have a daughter, he might wish to be excused from a
nearer relationship to him, notwithstanding the now plethoric
state of his money-bags.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The next morning he received a check for five thousand
dollars from the eccentric man, together with an expression
of gratitude for his faithful services. And this was the
foundation—the “foundation laid with his own hands”—which
Earle now began to build upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were no more idle days for him. Work poured in
upon him from every side. Success brought countless
friends, where before he had not possessed one and he
bade fair ere long to fulfill Richard Forrester’s prediction
concerning him—that he had a brilliant career before him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='large'>WILL HE BEAR THE TEST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Editha knew something of all this, for she read the papers,
and at the termination of the trial enough could not be
said of the brilliant victory which the young lawyer had
achieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was at Newport, but she would gladly have returned
to the city with her father to attend the trial had she known
of it in season.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he had merely said he was obliged to go home upon
business, which she judged upon his return must have been
of an unpleasant nature, since for several days afterward
he was morose and in every way disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one remarked how much more beautiful Miss Dalton
was this summer than the preceding one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many attributed it to the change in her dress, as she no
longer refused to wear colors, and her wardrobe was remarkable
for its taste and elegance, while others said her
sorrow was wearing away and her spirits were returning.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one but Editha herself, however, knew the secret of
her own beauty—she had loved and was beloved; and,
though her hopes might not be crowned for a long while,
yet she waited in patience for Earle to speak, having full
faith that he would eventually rise superior to every trial,
and trample every obstacle beneath his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>She and her father were less in sympathy than ever before.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had dared to displease him again by rejecting Mr.
Tressalia’s proposals of marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day following Earle’s call upon her—on that very
Christmas Day when she had contemplated asking him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>dinner, and making the day so pleasant to him—Mr. Dalton
had brought Mr. Tressalia home with him to be their
guest, and he had sat in the seat she had destined for Earle,
and she had been obliged to exert herself to entertain him
instead.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had also attended a grand reception with them in the
evening, and altogether that Christmas was so entirely different
from what she had planned it should be, that she was
a little inclined to feel almost as much out of patience with
the innocent cause of it as with her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days later Paul Tressalia had asked her to be his
wife, and she had been obliged to tell him “No, it could
not be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton was very angry, but secretly bade the rejected
lover hope, assuring him that Editha’s affections were
not engaged, and he, three months later, taking courage, renewed
his proposal, to receive the same answered as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>A stormy interview between father and daughter had followed,
Mr. Dalton declaring that she <em>should</em> marry the rich
Englishman, and Editha as firmly asserting that she should
not do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disappointed lover, however, followed them to Newport,
where he continually haunted every scene of pleasure
where the fair girl was to be found; and, to Editha’s shame,
she was at last forced to believe that her father was still bidding
him hope against hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be thought that Paul Tressalia was lacking in
either pride for himself or proper respect for the woman he
professed to love, by being so persistent but it was the one
passion of his life, although he was thirty years of age, and
he could not easily yield to her gentle though firm refusal,
particularly when Mr. Dalton told him he must eventually
overcome her objections if he was patient.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not presuming in his attentions; he never forced
his society upon her; yet, with a patience and faithfulness
that deserved a better return, he waited and hoped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you would but give me the least ray of hope that I
may eventually win your love, Miss Editha; my life will
be <em>ruined</em> without the crown of your love,” he had ventured
to urge once more, in a sorrowful kind of way, on
the last evening of her stay at Newport.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had heard she was going on the morrow and he could
not bear it; he <em>must</em> put his fate to the test once more and
for the last time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tressalia,” she entreated, in a pained voice, “what
<em>shall</em> I tell you to make you understand that it cannot be?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“There could be only <em>one</em> thing that you could tell me
that would destroy every gleam of hope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that?” she interrupted, with a quick breath and a
fluttering of her white lids.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That your love is given to another,” he said, passionately,
and searching, with sudden foreboding, the beautiful
face he loved so well.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rich blood surged instantly over cheek brow, and
neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could she confess that she loved another, when that love
was as yet unspoken even to its object?</p>

<p class='c007'>And yet she must not go away and leave him to feed on
a hopeless passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would it be maidenly? Would it be proper?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, have I been deceived all this while? Have I
been persecuting you with my attentions, while you loved
another?” he cried, in consternation, as he marked that
startled flush, and intuitively knew its cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked up into his white, pained face, and pitied
him from the depths of her tender heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tressalia,” she said, with sudden resolution, “it
is cruel to allow you to hope when there is no hope. I
will make you my confidant. You are noble and good,
and you will not betray my trust. What you have said—is
true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice was low, and sweet, and tremulous, as she confessed
it, but her face was dyed with hottest blushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <em>do</em> love some one else?” he cried, in a hollow voice,
his noble face growing gray and sharp with agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she whispered, “but only the exigency of the case
would force me to confess it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then she told him frankly all the story of her early
regard for Earle Wayne—his misfortune and patient endurance
for another’s crime—of his return, and of their mutual
though unspoken affection for each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle Wayne!” he repeated with a start. “Who is he?
Where did he come from?” he demanded, with eager interest,
as she spoke his name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know. He came to my uncle when seventeen
years of age. He was fatherless, motherless, and friendless;
but he has proved himself, if not honored among men,
to be stamped with Heaven’s nobility.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Would that Earle Wayne could have heard this tribute
from the woman he so loved!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wayne—is it spelled with a y?” Mr. Tressalia asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Of what nationality is he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“American, I judge, though I never heard him say aught
upon the subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Strange! strange!” Mr. Tressalia muttered, with thoughtful
brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>But after a few minutes of musing, he reached out and
clasped her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The confession she had made, and he had listened to, was
a strange one for a delicate and sensitive woman to make,
and his great heart was touched with sympathy for the
gallant lover, and with admiration for the woman who could
be so true and loyal to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Dalton,” he said, in earnest though slightly tremulous
tones, “I realize that all my hope must die; but what
you have told me only makes my loss so much greater and
harder to bear, for I honor you above women for the courage
you have manifested in telling me this. You are a
noble daughter of a noble country, and he who has won
your love will have cause to adore you all his life. That
he is worthy of you, notwithstanding his misfortune, I cannot
doubt, after what you have told me, and I do not believe
<em>you</em> could love <em>unworthily</em>. God bless him for his nobility,
and <em>you</em> for your constancy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha looked up astonished at this heartfelt benediction.
She had begun to regard him as lacking somewhat
in character and pride, when he had returned to plead his
cause after her repeated refusal, but now she saw that she
had underrated him. She saw that his love was deep and
true for her, and that he suffered as great men alone can
suffer when he found that he could never win her love;
but a mind that was capable of such generosity as to rise
above self—to admire and sympathize with a rival—was
worthy of the highest regard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am proud,” he went on, not noticing her look, “that
you have considered me worthy of this confidence; and, if
anything could assuage the pain I experience, the trust that
you repose in me would do it. Your confidence shall be inviolable,
and if there is anything that I can do at any time
to promote your happiness and Mr. Wayne’s interests, I pray
you will not hesitate to let me know it, and I will gladly
serve you both.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia did not realize what he was promising when
he said that, but there came a time when he was tried as
few men are ever tried; and—did he bear the test? We
shall see.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never in all her life had Editha regretted anything as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>she did at this moment that she had been obliged to blight
the hopes of this noble, whole-souled man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bright drops chased each other over her cheeks as
she thanked him for his kindness, and expressed her regret
that she had been obliged to cause him pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not grieve for me,” he said, gently, as almost involuntarily
he wiped her tears away with his own handkerchief.
“I know I must suffer as few suffer; but, Editha,
believe me, I would rather you would be happy in <em>another’s</em>
care and love than <em>unhappy</em> in <em>mine</em>. God bless you, my love—by
one only love, and perhaps He will yet comfort me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha arose and gave him her hand. She could not speak;
she could not bear anything more.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was her “good-night” and “good-by,” for the early
morning would find her on her way home.</p>

<p class='c007'>He watched her until the last flutter of her light robe
disappeared from view, and then, springing to his feet as
if a hot iron were burning his soul, he went out into the
night to battle alone with his rebellious heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The late mail that evening brought him letters containing
important news from and requiring his immediate presence
abroad. He left the next day for England, firmly believing,
that he never should look upon the face of Editha
Dalton in this world again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton and his daughter returned to their home in
the city, and settled down for the winter—Editha cheered
and happy to see Earle occasionally and to know of his
increasing success.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without saying anything to any one, on the morning
of her twenty-first birthday she repaired to Mr. Felton’s
office, and with a resolute face and steady hand, signed
the papers that gave to Earle Wayne ten thousand dollars,
together with a year’s interest, even as she had said she
would do.</p>

<p class='c007'>These papers she desired should be taken to him at once,
and in case he refused to accept the bequest, Mr. Felton
was authorized to safely invest the money and retain the
papers in his own possession until they should be called for.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle firmly refused to touch a cent of it, saying his business
was fast increasing, and he did not need it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was therefore taken by Mr. Felton to the First National
Bank, deposited in his name, and left to accumulate.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='large'>AN INTERVIEW INTERRUPTED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One day Earle was looking over his papers and arranging
them more systematically, when he came across a package
containing the memoranda and evidence used during that
“knotty case” wherein he was so successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>These had been wrapped in a newspaper, and had remained
untouched since that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he was looking them over, and considering whether
it would be best to keep them any longer or destroy them,
his eye caught sight of a paragraph, or name rather, in
the paper that instantly riveted his attention, and, with staring
eyes and paling cheek, he read it eagerly through.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he turned to look at the date of the paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the very same that he had bought that night when
he had been so forlorn and dreary, when for a week no
one had come to him to get him to do even so much as
a little copying, when he had counted his money and discovered
all he possessed in the world was a little over two
dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he remembered how recklessly he had gone to the
door to purchase the paper, and, returning, had turned on
the full blaze of gas to read by, and, before he had read half
a dozen lines, his strange client had appeared, and the paper
had been entirely forgotten from that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doubtless it would have been destroyed, and he never
would have seen this, to him, highly important paragraph
had it not been used as a wrapper for the papers which the
little, thin-visaged, wiry man had brought him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is hardly six months now since this paper was printed,”
he said, with a shade of anxiety on his face, as he turned
to look at the date again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he sat down to think, evidently deeply troubled and
perplexed about something.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the boy brought him in his evening paper, for
he could afford to have one regularly now, and mechanically
he unfolded it and began to read. He had nearly looked it
through, when, under the heading of “Gleanings,” he read
this:</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be remembered by the frequenters of Newport that
Mr. Paul Tressalia was suddenly recalled abroad, at the last
of the season, by the serious illness of his uncle, the Marquis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of Wycliffe, who has since died, and, being childless, Mr.
Tressalia thus becomes heir to his vast possessions in both
England and France, and also to his title.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s face was startlingly pale as he read this, while his
broad chest rose and fell heavily, as if he found a difficulty
in breathing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That must be the Paul Tressalia who was here last winter,
and—who was so attentive to Editha,” he said, with
white lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>For an hour he sat with bent head, deeply-lined brow, and
an expression of deep pain and perplexity on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must do it,” he said at last, “and the quicker the better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned to the shipping list and looked to see what
steamers sailed soon. He found two that were to sail on
the morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will do,” he said, and laid aside his paper, with an
expression of resolution on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he arose, locked his safe, donned his coat and hat,
and made his way directly to Mr. Dalton’s aristocratic mansion
on ——th street.</p>

<p class='c007'>He inquired for Editha of the servant who answered his
ring, and was immediately shown into the drawing-room,
where she sat alone. Her face lighted and flushed with
pleasure as she arose to greet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, you are very, <em>very</em> much of a stranger,” she said,
half reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been very, <em>very</em> busy,” he answered, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know—I read of your great success, and the papers
speak very creditably of the rising young lawyer, and the
friends of that young lawyer would be glad to see more of
him. Just think, you have only called once since our return
from Newport, and then I had other callers, and only saw
you for a few moments, while I have only met you once or
twice since on the street.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be very pleasant to come oftener, but you know
duty before pleasure and I fear my friends, what few I have,
will see even less of me in the future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have business that calls me abroad immediately; it is
of that I came to tell you to-night,” he said, with a grave
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abroad! Where?” Editha demanded, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To Europe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will—will you be gone long, Earle?” she asked, all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>light and beautiful color fading out of her face at this intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know—no longer than I can possibly help, for
I have work of great importance to do here yet,” he said,
with a sigh, and a note of bitterness in his tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha knew that he referred to the solving of the mystery
of the robbery. She, too, sighed heavily. It was like taking
all the joy out of her existence to know of his going away.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was in the same city and near, so that she could
see him occasionally, or hear of him even indirectly, she
could be reasonably content; but, with the ocean dividing
them, her heart would be heavy enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle marked her emotion, and his heart thrilled.</p>

<p class='c007'>How sweet it was to know that she loved him and would
miss him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose from his chair, and going to her, sat down by
her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha,” he said, in low, eager tones, “you will be glad
to learn that I think I have at last a clew to that wretched
business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, is it possible? And is that why you are going
away?” she asked, eagerly. “Have you found out who did
the deed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not quite that; but I have a clew, and I wish I need
not go just now; but other business of the most important
nature demands it. I had fondly hoped that before many
weeks should elapse I should be able to come to you and tell
you that no stain rests on my name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s eyes fell beneath his earnest glance. Well she
knew what would follow if he could once tell her that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, of course,” he went on, “all my work in that direction
will now have to be suspended for awhile. But,
Editha,” leaning toward her and scanning her drooping face
with great earnestness, “is your faith in me as strong as
ever?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Earle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Very sweet and low but firm came the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you will still trust me, even though I may be away
a long time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Always</em>, Earle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But this with a quick, deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked at her still, his lips trembling as if he longed
to say something, yet hesitated. Then he sat suddenly erect
and folded his arms tight across his chest, as if to still the
heavy beating of his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha,” he began, trying to steady his shaking voice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“you have told me that you have read of my success, and
know that I am winning the esteem and respect of men in
spite of the past. I am rising higher on the ladder of prosperity
every day, and money flows in rapidly upon me from
every side. If my business abroad proves as successful as it
has here, I have reason to hope that great good in a worldly
point of view is coming to me—just what that is I cannot
explain to you now—but under the circumstances I feel that
I cannot be silent any longer. I <em>cannot</em> go away from you
without speaking the words I have so longed to utter—to tell
you of the deep and mighty love I have had to chain as with
iron bands for a long time. Editha, I have loved you for
more than half a dozen years. When I came to you last
Christmas, alone and friendless, believing that you also had
ceased to remember me, I can never tell you the revulsion
of feeling I experienced when you gave me your simple but
heartfelt greeting, while there was that in your eyes and
manner which told me I might hope that you could love me
in return. Your kindness and trust in me were almost more
than I could bear at that time. I could have fallen down
before you and kissed the hem of your garments, for your
divine charity toward one upon whom all others looked with
scorn or pity, as if I was afflicted with some deadly and incurable
plague. My darling, did I read aright? Did not
your yes tell me that day that you could love me if I could
come to you with stainless name? Will you give me that
assurance now, before I go away? Will you tell me that
when I have cleared away that blight from my life—<em>as I
shall clear it yet</em>—you will be my wife?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The last word was spoken in an intense whisper, as if it
was too sacred to be uttered aloud, while he paused and
scarcely breathed as he awaited her reply, his noble face
illuminated with an earnest pleading more eloquent than his
burning words had been.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen all along that Editha Dalton was possessed
of a character remarkable for its veracity and straightforward
feeling. She realized now that this was the most
serious and sacred moment of her whole life—that upon
her reply hung the happiness of her own and Earle’s future.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no coyness, no hesitation in her answer, though
no lack of maidenly delicacy and dignity in her words and
manner, as she lifted her flushed face, glorified with the
light of her noble, steadfast love for him, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, if you had told me all this last Christmas-time
you need not have lived quite such a lonely, loveless life ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>since. I believe I have loved you from the time when you
first came to Uncle Richard’s, only I never found it out until
the day of your trial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, can it be possible?” Earle exclaimed, his face
almost transfigured by her words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Earle, I used to wish that you were my <em>brother</em>
in those days; but when I bade you good-by that afternoon
after your trial, it came to me that it was no sisterly feeling
that I entertained for you, but something deeper, stronger,
and more sacred.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling,” he cried, fairly trembling beneath the weight
of his great happiness, and yet scarcely able to credit what
he heard, “you <em>would</em> not say this if you did not <em>mean</em> it—you
would not allow me to grasp this hope and then let it
<em>fail</em> me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She lifted her clear eyes to his.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, do you think I could love you all these years and
then trifle with the affection which is the most precious gift
Heaven ever sent to me?” she asked, with grave sweetness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no; and yet for the moment my brain almost reeled—it
did not seem possible that such joy could be really meant
for me, after what I have suffered,” he returned, with a
deep breath of thankfulness that was almost a sob, as he
drew her tenderly into his arms and laid the golden head
upon his breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was cruel, <em>so</em> cruel,” she murmured, with trembling
lips; “I know I shall never be able to realize all you have
suffered, Earle, but not a day passed that my heart did not
cry out in rebellion against your fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is all past now, my own; let us not live it over again;
and the joy you have given me to-day will brighten all the
future,” he said, laying his lips reverently against the shining
hair that crowned the head upon his breast. “Can it be
possible,” he added, after a few moments of silence, “that
you would have pledged yourself to me last Christmas—to
<em>me</em> only a few hours out of prison, after serving a <em>convict’s
sentence</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She laid her hand upon his lips as if to stay the hateful
words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fact of your having suffered unjustly for the crime
of another only made me love you the more tenderly—I
regarded you just as worthy of my affection then as you will
ever be,” Editha returned, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God ever bless you for those words, my darling! And
you will be my wife, Editha, some time when——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“I <em>will</em> be your wife, Earle,” she interrupted, not allowing
him to finish his sentence, for she knew what he was
about to add.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But suppose I should never succeed in finding those rascals
who committed the robbery—suppose the doubt must
ever rest upon me?” he persisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will make no difference, Earle. <em>You</em> know you are
innocent; <em>I</em> know it! why then need we make ourselves
miserable over what the world may say or think?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you do not care—you will never be troubled or
ashamed if others scorn me and give me the cold shoulder?”
he asked, astonished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, dear,” she said, with a smile that had something
of sadness in it; “I cannot say that I do not care, for I
would like every one to honor you, even as I honor you,
and I feel assured that they will yet do so; meanwhile we
will be as happy as we can be. <em>Ashamed</em> of you I can
<em>never</em> be—please do not allow such a thought to enter your
mind again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, you were rightly named. Do you know what it
means?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I never even thought to ask if it had a meaning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It means happiness. Who gave it to you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Richard said that he named me.” Editha answered,
with a thoughtful, far-away look in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been an inspiration, for I believe you
bring happiness to every one with whom you come in contact,”
Earle said, in tones of intense feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you <em>are</em> happy, Earle, in spite of all?” Editha asked,
lifting her head and regarding him wistfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling—my darling, I cannot tell you how happy;
the very best of earth’s treasures should be laid at your
feet, if I had them, to testify to it, and I trust the day is
not far distant when I shall be able to bring you a goodly
measure of them,” he returned, folding her closer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have brought me the most precious one in all the
world to-day, Earle—your dear love,” the fair girl answered,
softly, and almost awed by the strength and depth of his
affection for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! if I did not need to go away!” Earle said, with a
sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I, too, wish that you did not—the time will seem long
until you return,” Editha returned, regretfully; then she
added, suddenly: “Is it absolutely necessary that you should
go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; it cannot be avoided. If I were sure of success I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>would tell you the nature of the business which calls me
abroad; but you can trust me a little longer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Always.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And would you, some time in the future, be willing to
go abroad to live if it was necessary?” Earle asked, with
a peculiar expression on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anywhere in the world with you, Earle, if need be;” and,
with a tender smile, Editha laid both her hands on his.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was as if she was willing to renounce everything in the
world for him and his precious love, and the act touched
him as nothing ever had done before.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed his manly head until his lips rested upon them
in a fervent, reverent caress.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that instant the door near which they were sitting
swung softly open, and before they were aware of his presence,
Mr. Dalton had entered, and was standing before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had come in a few minutes previous, and the waiter
had told him that Earle Wayne was there, which intelligence
so enraged him that he determined at once to put a stop to
all further visits from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether he had been guilty of listening before entering
the room they could not tell, but certain it is that he presented
himself before them with a most disagreeable smile
upon his face and a glitter in his steel-gray eyes that boded
them no good.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='large'>A FATHER’S THREAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! Mr. <em>Wayne</em>!” with a peculiar emphasis upon his
name that somehow startled Earle. “Quite an interesting occasion.
Pray, Miss Dalton, are you in the <em>habit</em> of entertaining
your callers in this extremely—ah—<em>amazing</em> manner?”
he demanded, with a cold sneer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s fair face flushed with mingled shame and indignation
at his coarseness, while Earle’s eyes flashed dangerously
at his almost insulting manner to his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, Mr. Wayne sails for Europe to-morrow,” Editha
said, to divert his attention, and hoping thus to tide over a
scene until Earle should be out of the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, indeed? I am happy to hear it—extremely happy
to hear it,” with a satirical bow to Earle, yet with a start of
surprise and a searching glance into the young man’s face;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“and I presume he was taking a <em>friendly</em> leave of you, my
dear; quite interesting—quite affecting—ah! quite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to describe the malice and satire contained
in his words, or the evil expression on Mr. Dalton’s
face, as his eyes restlessly searched first one countenance and
then the other of the lovers before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>No, sir!</em>” Earle replied, rising, and pale to ghastliness
with the effort he made at self-control at this insulting language
and manner. “I was not taking <em>leave</em> of Miss Dalton,
and, since I do not approve of concealments or secret engagements,
I will state that she has just consented to do me
the honor to become my wife at some future time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man stood proudly erect, confronting his enemy,
and still holding one of Editha’s hands, as he made this
bold statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do <em>you</em> dare stand there and tell <em>me</em> this?” Mr. Dalton
hissed, with strange malignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why should I not dare, sir?” Earle asked, with
forced respect, remembering that he was speaking to Editha’s
father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton did not reply, but, turning fiercely upon
Editha, demanded, in a voice of concentrated passion:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is what he says truth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, papa,” she replied, firmly, but with downcast eyes
and painfully flushed cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have promised to <em>marry him</em>?” pointing with a shaking
finger at Earle, and speaking in the same tone as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have dared to do this thing without either my knowledge
or sanction? <em>You</em> marry a thing like <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The blue eyes were downcast no longer, but flashed up to
meet his, with a clear and steady glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir!” she began, and her tones, though respectful, were
firm and unfaltering, “I was twenty-one years of age some
time ago, and I can now, so to speak, act upon my own authority,
if I choose. I am, at all events, old enough to know
my own mind, and I believe I told you once before that I
consider I have a right to judge and act for myself in a
matter so vital to my own happiness and interests.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She paused a moment, and her look of independence
changed to one of pain, as she added, more gently:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would much to prefer to have your consent and approbation
in all that I do, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will have my curses and hate instead,” he interrupted,
nearly purple with passion that she should face him
so dauntlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Please do not say that, papa,” Editha cried, in deep distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton,” Earle now said gravely, yet feeling as if
he could hardly keep his hands off the man for wounding her
so, “may I ask <em>what</em> your objections are to my union with
Miss Dalton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems exceedingly strange to me that you should <em>need</em>
to ask any <em>respectable</em> and honorable citizen what his objections
would naturally be to <em>your</em> marrying his daughter,” was
the intensely sarcastic reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle flushed, but still controlled himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand you, sir,” he said, proudly “but I can assure
you that I am guiltless of the deed which you would impute
to me. I have even now a clew to the real culprits——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have?” Mr. Dalton interrupted, with a startled look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, and though I have suffered a felon’s disgrace;
yet let them once be brought to justice, and my name will
be cleared from every breath of taint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Your name will be cleared from every breath of taint!</em>”
Mr. Dalton repeated, with an emphasis and look that made
Earle start violently and regard him with perplexity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he answered, with firm assurance:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; I think I can safely promise that in six months
from this time I shall be able to convince you that I am as
honorable and respectable a man as you yourself claim to be,
and shall be able to offer Miss Dalton a position in life that
even you will be proud to accept for her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton now started as if stung at these last words,
and his face would have been a study for a painter.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had grown very pale while Earle was speaking, and
his countenance wore a half-frightened, perplexed expression,
while his eyes were fixed upon the young man as if
fascinated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you do this thing? What do you mean?” he
at last demanded, in a wondering tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon me if I say I cannot explain just now,” he answered,
with a slight smile, and a quick, fond glance at
Editha, as if <em>she</em> would be the first one to be told of any
good that came to him; “but, providing that I can thus convince
you of my honesty and respectability, will you then
consent to my union with Editha?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>No!</em>” burst from the irate man, who seemed to recover
himself at this question.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle looked surprised, and as if utterly unable to comprehend
the man’s strange demeanor, and his peculiar animosity
toward him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“Have you any <em>other</em> objection to my making Miss Dalton
my wife?” he asked, in his straightforward way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, <em>I have</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I ask what it is?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may ask, but it does not follow that I shall tell you.
Suffice it to say that you shall <em>never</em> marry Editha Dalton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne smiled calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon me, but that is a question which Editha alone
can decide,” he replied, respectfully but confidently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha! do you think so?” sneered Mr. Dalton. Then
turning to Editha, with a malicious smile, he demanded:
“And what is <em>your</em> opinion about the matter, miss?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish we could be at peace, papa. Oh, why cannot
you be reasonable, and let me be happy?” she exclaimed,
with gathering tears and a bitter pain at the rupture she
foresaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak! What do you think of your lover’s statement?”
reiterated Mr. Dalton, harshly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I must speak—then—I must,” she began, with quiet
dignity, “although I dislike to cause you either anger or
sorrow. I think this is a matter which <em>I</em> alone can decide,
and—<em>I have decided</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>How</em> have you decided?” thundered Mr. Dalton, striding
toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have decided that if we both do live, I shall be Earle
Wayne’s wife,” she said, with a quiet firmness that left
no room for doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>A proud, glad light leaped into Earle’s face at these brave
words, though he would cheerfully have shielded her at
almost any cost from this angry scene with her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha! you have, have you?” he returned, in tones that
made her shrink from him and move nearer Earle, as if
for protection from some impending ill, though she knew
not what.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton marked the gesture, and it enraged him still
more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you think you love this fine young gentleman
very much,” he said, with a strange smile upon his
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, I do,” she answered, unflinchingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you, sir?” turning fiercely upon Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would not have deigned to reply to the trivial question
had he not deemed it best for Editha’s sake to temporize
with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have loved Miss Dalton since the day Mr. Forrester introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>me to her, more than six years ago,” he answered,
quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can crush you both with a breath—you shall <em>never</em>
marry each other,” Sumner Dalton whispered, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle thought this but an idle threat, uttered in the heat
of passion, and paid no particular heed to it; but he longed
to put an end to the disgraceful scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton,” he said, speaking very calmly, “why will
you not listen to reason? Do you not see that there is
nothing to be gained by so much passionate opposition?
Editha and I are both of age, capable to act for ourselves,
and we both also believe that there can be no impediment to
our union except, perhaps, the fancied one of a social unfitness;
and for that we do not propose to sacrifice the happiness
of our lives. I do not desire to be at enmity with
you, and I cannot understand why you should be so violent
in your dislike of me, since I am not conscious of ever having
done you any injury. I do not mean to be unreasonable in
my resistance of your will and authority, but your own good
sense will tell you that no man would lightly yield the woman
he loved as his own life; and, while I believe that every child
should obey the divine injunction to ‘honor one’s parents,’
yet there <em>is</em> a limit beyond which this will not apply. Now,
if you have any good and sufficient reason for what you
assert, I desire to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton’s eyes had been fixed upon him while he was
speaking in that same strange gaze that he had noticed once
before, and now, as then, he had grown deadly pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a good and sufficient reason, and I would see her
on the rack before I would allow <em>you</em> to marry her,” he said,
bending towards him and speaking with a vindictiveness that
sent a cold chill creeping over Earle’s flesh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, papa, what can you mean?” exclaimed Editha, with
a shudder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot understand this fierce hatred which you seem
to entertain for me,” began Earle, regarding him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have hit the nail on the head at last. I hate you—<em>I
hate you</em>—and I have <em>cause</em> to hate you,” Sumner Dalton
answered, shaking like a leaf in the wind, as he uttered the
fearful words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I repeat, I cannot understand it,” Earle said, wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose, practically speaking, you do not even know
the meaning of the word,” sneered Mr. Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <em>hope</em> I do not, sir. We are commanded not to hate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>but rather to love our enemies, and to do good to those who
injure us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you put that in practice, since you preach it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <em>desire</em> to practice it most certainly,” was the grave
response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How would it be if you could find those real thieves, for
whom you pretend you have suffered disgrace?” was the
searching query.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s face was very noble and earnest as he returned,
thoughtfully:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beyond proving my own innocence, and justifying myself
in the yes of the world, I believe I can honestly say I wish
them no ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you would revenge yourself by making them serve
a <em>double sentence</em>, if you could?” demanded Mr. Dalton,
skeptically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might be necessary for the good of the public that they
should be put where they could do no more injury; but it
would afford me no personal gratification, I can assure you,”
Earle answered, with a sigh, feeling that it would be but
sad pleasure to be the cause of another’s serving out a term
of weary years in State prison, as he had done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a pitying glance at his enemy, he said, even
more gently than he had yet spoken:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton, did you never read what Milton says of that
ignoble sentiment of which you speak?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Revenge, at first though sweet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bitter ere long back on itself recoils.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton laughed, mockingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should have continued your very apt quotation, for,
if I remember rightly, a few lines below read like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I reck not, so it light well aimed—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Spite then with spite is best repaid.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I must confess that your creed is beyond both my comprehension
and inclination; and, mark my words, you yourself
will yet prove it fallacious by practical illustration.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust not, sir; the world would be a sad place in which
to live if such passion ran riot in the hearts of all men,”
Earle said, sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let an enemy fall into your hands and see; let some one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>do you a deadly injury—let him crush your hopes, and
every prospect for the fulfillment of your ambitious desires,
and bar you forever from the one prize you covet most
on earth, and then see if you will preach about love to your
enemies,” Mr. Dalton said, with a fierceness that was absolutely
startling, and Earle wondered more and more what
possible connection all this could have with his hatred of
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not conscious of having crushed any of his hopes,
nor of hindering the fulfillment of any ambitious desires, nor
of barring him from any coveted prize, although he thought
Mr. Dalton was guilty of all this in regard to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are <em>you</em> not doing that very thing now? Are you not
seeking to wrest from me the dearest object which earth
holds for me?” he asked, gently, and really pitying one who
was so at the mercy of his fierce passions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and aren’t you longing to grapple me with those
powerful hands of yours and crush me for it?” he laughed
in return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Honestly, no, Mr. Dalton,” Earle exclaimed, with solemn
earnestness; “I would not avail myself of the slightest advantage
to do you an injury. You suffer more from the exercise
of your own vindictiveness than I ever can from its
effects.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yet you are determined to marry <em>her</em>,” with a gesture
toward Editha, who now sat with bowed head weeping, “in
spite of all my threats?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not ‘in spite of your threats,’ Mr. Dalton, for they do
not move me in the least; but because our love and our happiness
are both too sacred to be sacrificed to the malice of
any one,” Earle replied, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will not heed me—you are determined to marry
Editha?” he demanded, scowling darkly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Miss Dalton consents to be my wife, I shall most certainly
make her so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you will not be warned?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What possible cause, sir, can you have for this fierce
opposition and resentment? <em>Will</em> you tell me?” Earle demanded,
nearly wearied out with this controversy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>No</em>; that is my secret—I shall not tell it to you. <em>I shall
keep it to crush you both with; and crush you it will, if you
attempt to thwart me</em>,” he answered, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle bent his head in deep thought for a moment, then,
seeking Mr. Dalton’s eye with a searching look, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton, tell me one thing; it is not possible—you
do not think that it is Editha’s money I am seeking?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“It would not be so strange a thing if you were; Editha
has a pretty penny of her own; but let me tell you not a
dollar of it will you get more than you have already got,”
he snapped, savagely, and with a scowl at his daughter, as
he thus referred to her defiance of him regarding Richard
Forrester’s legacy to Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have never touched that money, sir, nor do I ever intend
to do so; and it seems to me as if that fact alone should convince
you that I am no fortune-hunter,” the young man
said, flushing with disgust that such a motive should be imputed
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a very pretty theory, and doubtless wins that
silly girl’s warmest admiration, as being so disinterested
and noble in you; when, if you should be so fortunate as
to succeed in your designs to marry her, you would have
the handling of the whole,” was the sarcastic rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, if you were any other than Editha’s father you would
be made to repent of and apologize for those words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s eyes emitted glances of fire, and his clenched hands
and heaving chest showed how hard it was for him to refrain
from bestowing the chastisement the evil-minded man so
richly merited.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sardonic grin for a moment distorted Mr. Dalton’s features
at these words; but, turning to Editha, who at that
last insult to her lover had risen and now stood at his side,
white and quivering with pain and indignation, he said, in
low, concentrated tones:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remember, if you dare to defy me in this matter as you
did in the other, my secret and my hate shall crush you
both.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, without another word, he turned and left the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='large'>THE PARTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Earle, what can he mean? For the first time in my
life I am actually afraid of my own father,” Editha said,
sinking back upon the sofa from which she had so recently
arisen, and bursting into nervous weeping.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle knelt upon the floor beside her, and, lifting her
head to his breast, folded his strong arms around her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling, I think he is so beside himself with anger
at some fancied injury that he scarcely knows what he means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>himself. Do not allow his words to distress you, Editha,
and time, I feel, will bring everything right,” he said, soothingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa has changed so during the last two or three years—I
cannot understand it at all. He used to pet and indulge
me as a child, and only laughed at my whims and fancies,
as he termed my childish wilfulness; but, since mamma’s and
Uncle Richard’s death, he has seemed entirely indifferent.
He will not bear the least opposition from me upon any
subject. We have had more than one controversy regarding
you, Earle—I <em>will</em> stand up for what I know to be right and
honorable, and if it happens to conflict with his ideas, he is
so angry. Besides——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped suddenly, blushing vividly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my ‘happiness?’” Earle said, encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had occasion to offend him deeply not long ago, and
I suppose he cannot recover from his disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she went on to tell him of Mr. Tressalia’s proposals,
and her repeated rejection of the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should not feel it right to speak of this to any one
else,” she said, in conclusion, “for I think it is very wrong
for any woman to boast of having given pain in any such
way; but henceforth I am to have no secrets from you, and it
is but proper that you should know of this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought perhaps Mr. Tressalia would win you, Editha,
at one time, and such <em>was</em> the report,” Earle said, wondering
if she had read of that gentleman’s succession to a marquisate
and great possessions.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she knew nothing of it as yet, and only nestled nearer
to him as she returned:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you hear of that, Earle, and did you believe it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot say that I <em>really</em> believed it, for I cherished a
little hope myself all the time; and yet I do not know but
that it is a wonder he did not carry off my treasure after
all,” he returned, as he folded her closer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it is not a wonder; if there had been no <em>Earle Wayne</em>
in existence, I <em>might have</em> learned to love <em>him</em>, but there <em>was</em>
an Earle Wayne in the world, consequently it was an impossibility,”
Editha answered, with a twinkling little smile in
her deep blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle bent and touched her red lips with fond thanks for
the sweet words they had uttered; but there was an expression
of thoughtfulness mingled with anxiety on his
brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tressalia is a noble man, if he is all you represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>him, and it is a sad thing to have all his hopes blighted
thus,” he said, in tones of regret.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I cannot tell you how sorry I was for him, and I
hope I may never see such a look on another face as long as
I live as I saw on his when I left him that night,” Editha
replied, her eyes filling with tears at the remembrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha,” Earle said, suddenly, after a short silence, “<em>you</em>
do not believe that I care for your fortune—that I give it
even a thought?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sensitive Earle, no,” she answered, with a skeptical
smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I am going to propose a bold measure. I dread—I
almost fear to go away and leave you. I know you will
be unhappy with your father’s displeasure constantly following
you, and I have a strange presentiment—something tells
me that I must not leave you behind. Editha will you marry
me and go with me to Europe to-morrow as my wife?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She started from his unfolding arms, sitting suddenly erect,
her face as white as a snow-flake at the proposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does the idea startle you so, my own? It is so sudden,
I know; but would it not be best for our mutual happiness?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And papa—would be left behind entirely alone,” she said,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only for a short time, dearest. I shall return as soon
as I can arrange my business there to do so, even if I have
to go back afterward. Perhaps by that time Mr. Dalton
will look at matters in a different light from what he does
now,” Earle urged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha heaved a long sigh that meant a good many things.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, I would like it <em>so</em> much,” she said, sorrowfully,
after a long and thoughtful pause, “both the going to Europe,
where I have always longed to go, and—being your
wife; but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>His arms clasped her more tightly at that word of doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Must there be a ‘but?’” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid there must,” and her hand went up to his
face with a caressing motion. “Perhaps if I stay and
wait I may be able to win papa over to our way of thinking.
At any rate, I must strive for peace with him. It
will not be so very long, will it, Earle?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot tell, dear, exactly how long. I may have to
be gone six months; I do not think it can possibly take
any longer than that to decide my case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Six months!” with another sigh and slight quiver of her
lips. “I feel that it is best to wait, Earle. I must be patient,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and try to do what is right. Papa may be angry with me,
but I cannot think he is wholly devoid of affection for me,
and he is so alone in the world, he might miss me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It shall be just as you wish or say,” Earle replied, but
looking disappointed nevertheless. It really seemed to him
as if something told him he <em>must not</em> leave her behind. “I
would rather come to you with my hands full,” he added;
“and Editha, if I am successful in my business abroad, I
feel that even your father, with all his prejudice against me,
will be proud to give you to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That settles it, then Earle; we shall wait; for it is better
to win than to displease him. But I shall miss you; it is hard
to let you go,” she said, with a quiver in her voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling, do you not think it is hard also for me to
go away and leave you—particularly as I fear you are not
going to be very happy? And, dearest, for fear that something
may happen to our letters, in the <em>same way that there
did your flowers</em>, I will secure a lock-box at the office for
you before I go, and send you the key.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will be a good plan,” she answered, flushing.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was hard to feel that her father would be guilty of
anything so underhanded as to intercept her letters, but she
had discovered, by questioning his servant, that he had intercepted
and destroyed her flowers, and the distrust now
would naturally arise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Every mail, dear,” Earle went on, “I shall expect to hear
from you, and I will write as often to you. Now, my darling,
I must say farewell. I shall not have time to come again,
as I have much to do, and the steamer sails to-morrow
at noon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So soon? Can I let you go so soon?” Editha sighed;
then, looking up with an effort to smile, she added: “I ought
not to murmur, for, of course, the sooner you go the sooner
you will return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is my brave little comforter. I could not bear to
leave you sorrowing. Now put your hands in mine and tell
me once for all that you love me, then I can go quite content,”
Earle pleaded; but his lips trembled slightly, nevertheless,
as they sought hers in a mute caress, for this parting
was not an easy thing for him, strong man though he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha folded her white hands together and laid them upon
his palm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love you, Earle; I never have loved any one but you;
and I shall love only you as long as my life shall last,”
she said, solemnly, her grave, sweet eyes lifted with a beautiful
trust to his face.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Bless you, my ‘happiness;’ I cannot help calling you that,
it is so fitting; those words will ring sweetly in my ears all
the long months I am separated from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He bent and touched her white forehead with his lips,
then, with a long, fond embrace, he bade her farewell and
went away.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>At half-past eleven the next morning Editha Dalton’s carriage
might have been seen drawn close to the wharf near
where the great steamer which was to bear her lover across
the ocean lay panting like a thing of life in mortal agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle had said he could not come to see her again, but
she had resolved to go to see him off instead.</p>

<p class='c007'>She must look once more into his face, and hear him
speak again in the tones that had grown so dear to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her fair face looked forth from the carriage window, her
eager eyes anxiously searching the countenance of each new-comer
as he hurried toward the boat anxious to secure his
state-room and get settled for the voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps, after all, she thinks, as she looks in vain for the
beloved face, she was foolish to come, and will miss him
in the throng and confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>But her heart longs inexpressibly for one last look, and
word, and hand-clasp, and she resolves to linger until the
last moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>But suddenly her face lights and flushes, and a glad, tender
gleam beams from her beautiful eyes. She sees a manly
form coming with quick, firm tread toward the wharf.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also is evidently musing upon something pleasant for
a smile of rare sweetness curls his handsome lips, and lights
his noble face.</p>

<p class='c007'>All at once he lifts his head, and, as if drawn by some
magnetic influence, his eyes meet those of his betrothed,
and, with a bound, he is beside her carriage in an instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling! I did not expect this,” he said, with a warm
clasp of her hand, his face all aglow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not help it, Earle; it was foolish in me, I suppose,
after you had once said ‘good-by,’” she said, with a
lovely color rising in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A very agreeable kind of foolishness to me, dear; and
I shall take it as a good omen for my journey, that I have
had such a pleasant surprise,” he answered, smiling tenderly
down upon that lovely face, with its shining golden
crown.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the most beautiful thing in all the world to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was not sure of seeing you, but I thought at least I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>should see the vessel that was to take you away from me,
and that would be something,” she returned, with an answering
smile, though it bade fair to be rather a dewy one,
judging from the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you so dread to have me go, Editha? I <em>wish</em> I might
have taken you with me,” he said, wistfully, as he noted
the tears “something unaccountably impresses me that you
will not be safe until I have you within my sheltering care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not express another regret if it is going to trouble
you so; but, Earle, I shall be glad to have <em>you</em> safely back
again,” she returned, leaning toward him with a yearning on
her fair face that thrilled him through and through.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling, do you know how very lovely you are?” he
asked, with eager fondness, as his eyes lingered upon the
sweet picture before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She flashed a brilliant glance at him and colored beautifully
at this involuntary tribute.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should not say such things to me, Earle. You will
make me vain,” she said, with playful chiding, yet her lips
wore a smile of tremulous tenderness, as if she was glad to be
lovely in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>He laughed softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am to tell you just what I like, my own, all the rest of
your life. Do you know it? And I am not in the least afraid
of the result of which you speak. Do you know, beloved,”
dropping his voice and speaking with an intensity that moved
her whole being, “that all the world has changed for me
since yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A quick, luminous glance up into the eyes bent so fondly
upon her, a rare, sweet smile and a deepening flush, told
him that this change had not touched him alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ringing of a bell now startled them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must not detain you,” Editha said, with a sigh and an
anxious glance at the steamer, where all was bustle and confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not long, I fear. But you will take good care of my ‘happiness’
for me while I am away?” he returned, tenderly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do the best that I can, Earle; but how I shall
wish the time away. See, I have brought you these, and,”
with a sly look and smile, “if you can read this mute language,
you will know all I would like to tell you and cannot,”
and she put into his hands an elegant and carefully
selected bouquet of flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took them with fond thanks, and involuntarily laid the
bright blossoms, weighted with their fragrance, against his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>lips. Then, with a sudden start and a brilliant smile, he
said, eagerly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! strange I did not think before; but now I can give
you something that I purchased this morning, hoping to
have time to drop it in the office for you, but did not after
all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took a little case from his pocket, opened it, and drew
forth a lovely ring, set with one large, rare, pure pearl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold out the finger I want, Editha,” he commanded,
softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, with downcast eyes and a deeper, richer surging of
color, she held out the forefinger of her left hand, while,
with a look of reverence and solemn joy, he slipped the
ring to its place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad that I can put it on myself, instead of sending
it, as I thought I must. Do you like it, Editha?” he
asked, regarding the shyly downcast face with exceeding tenderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot tell you how much, Earle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad. I suppose, however, that a diamond would
have been the proper thing, since, being the most precious
stone, it perhaps more fitly represents the most precious gift
a man can receive; but to me this pure hearted pearl is
a more appropriate symbol of the love I have won than the
cold glitter of diamonds. My darling, this small hand belongs
to me now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Earle, it is all your own,” Editha answered, now
raising her eyes, which were full of tender tears, to his.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a movement graceful as it was involuntary, she
lifted her hand and touched her lips to the pure, gleaming
pearl.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s look spoke volumes as he noted the act, and brought
the ever-ready blushes quickly to the fair face again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha smiled, and, to cover her confusion, said, archly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is well, is it not, to yield <em>gracefully</em> to the bonds that
bind one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My love—my love!” Earle answered, with a look of
tender affection, “you never can know how precious you
are to me. I wish—oh, how I wish I could take you with
me; but I must go now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With no other farewell than one long, long hand-clasp,
one fond, lingering glance—for other eyes were upon them—he
was gone, mingling with the crowd, and so passed from
her sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night, when Sumner Dalton saw the pale gleam of
that pure pearl upon Editha’s finger, a sinister look crept into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>his eyes and curved the corners of his mouth, though he gave
no other sign that he had seen it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do they think to defy me thus?” he muttered to himself,
when he was alone again. “Let them beware, <em>both</em>
of them. I will not brook such opposition to my will.
If it were not for the very convenient purse of little Miss
Independence, I would crush her now, before this thing
goes any further. What can the youngster have gone to
Europe for? It cannot be that——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton seemed to be smitten with some sudden
and startling thought that made him grow very pale and
troubled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” he went on, after thinking awhile, “it is as
utterly <em>impossible</em> as that the sun should cease to shine.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='large'>EDITHA BESTOWS CHARITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The time, for the first week or two after Earle’s departure,
dragged heavily to Editha, and then, with her usual good
sense, she resolved to fill up the months of his absence with
work—the very best antidote in the world for all life’s weariness
and ills. Consequently, she set herself a daily task in
music and in perfecting herself in the languages of German
and French, and after that time flew as if on magic wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twice every week she wrote to Earle, and twice every
week she heard from him. And such letters as they were,
too! Full of such deep, strong, abiding devotion as only
such men as he are capable of feeling and expressing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether Mr. Dalton suspected the flight and reception
of these little white-winged messengers of love was a matter
of doubt to Editha. At all events they were none of them
intercepted or tampered with, since she alone held the key
to lock-box 1,004, and trusted no one else with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She wondered often what the nature of Earle’s business
abroad could be, and what great good he expected it to bring
him if he was successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>She wondered if it was some case connected with the lords
and nobles of that country, and by which some American
descendant expected to be elevated to the nobility of the
land.</p>

<p class='c007'>She built many a romance and castle in the air, but whether
they would stand or fall she could not tell until her lover’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>return. He did not mention business matters to her in his
letters, and therefore she had no means of knowing whether
he was meeting with success or not.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>“Please, miss, give me a dime, my father is dying and we’ve
neither fire nor bread.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These were the plaintive words which greeted Editha’s ears
one cold, threatening evening, as she was hurrying to reach
the shelter of her home before the storm should overtake
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been out, as usual, to recite her German and
French, and on returning had stopped to do a little shopping,
and it had begun to grow dark before she was through.</p>

<p class='c007'>In passing through a narrow alley to shorten the distance
and catch a car, the above words had fallen upon her
ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>No bread, no fire this cold, dismal night, she thought,
with a shudder, as a blue, emaciated hand was extended to
receive the pittance craved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha involuntarily stopped and turned toward the voice,
and found herself face to face with a young girl of about
fourteen years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was tall for her age, and painfully thin, and very
scantily clad. A thin and tattered shawl was wrapped around
her shoulders, and one end also served for a covering for
her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her stockings were nothing but a covering to hide the
nakedness of her limbs, while through the gaping shoes,
which had never been mates, Editha could plainly see her
cold and purple toes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sad face was blue and pinched, with such a hungry,
appealing look in the large, dark eyes that it went straight
to Miss Dalton’s heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>For an instant, as she stood there beside the forlorn
little waif, her own rich furs and elegant velvet cloak, with
its costly trimmings, brushing that scantily-clad figure, a
feeling of shame and self-condemnation rushed over her
that so much should be lavished upon herself while one of
Christ’s poor was in want and suffering so near.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How cold you look, my poor child! Why don’t you
go home, instead of staying here in the dismal street?” she
asked, pityingly. The girl shivered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We haven’t got any fire at home. If some one would
only give me a dime!” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No fire on this wretched day?” Editha repeated, sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“No, miss; and father’s dying, and mother nearly stupid
with the cold, and we haven’t had anything to eat to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” gasped Editha, horrified.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought, miss, if I could only beg a dime of some
one,” the girl went on, encouraged by her sympathy, “I could
buy a few coals and make father a little gruel—there <em>is</em> a
handful of meal left.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her pitying heart prompted her to go at once to ascertain
and relieve the necessities of these wretched people;
but she knew it was not always safe for a lady to enter
those poverty-stricken abodes alone, and particularly so late
in the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not sure either that the girl was telling her the
truth, though she undoubtedly was an object of charity, and
should not be left to suffer in her thin clothing—and there
was no mistaking the look of hunger in her wan face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking up, she espied a policeman not far distant. She
beckoned him, and he immediately responded to her summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know much about the people in this street?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, miss; I know that they’re a miserable set, mostly,”
he returned, politely touching his hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miserable?—how?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, so poor they can hardly keep soul and body together,
while some of them are desperate and vicious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This girl tells me that her father is dying, and they
have no fire, nor anything to eat. Do you know her?”
Editha asked, calling his attention to her companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, this is Milly Loker,” he said, recognizing her at
once. “Yes, I know her well, and I reckon she’s told you
the truth, for they’ve had a hard time of it along back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If this is the case I will go home with her and see what
I can do to relieve their suffering. I am alone, and it is growing
dark, so if you will please have an eye upon this vicinity
for the next half-hour or so, I shall be obliged to you,” Editha
said, as she turned to go with Milly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, miss; I’ll see that no harm comes to you, and the
house is only a few steps from here,” he answered respectfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. And now, my poor child, I will see what I
can do for your comfort,” Editha said, turning to the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found her wiping away the great tears with a corner
of her shawl, and her heart was deeply touched at the sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without saying anything in reply, she turned and walked
toward a miserable-looking tenement-house only a few steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>away. The door hung swinging upon one hinge, making
a dismal, creaking noise that sent the chills anew over
Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing up a flight of dirty, broken stairs, Milly opened
another door, which led into a bare and wretched-looking
apartment, having only one window, and that broken in
several places, the holes being stuffed with rags. Upon a rude
bed in one corner lay the wasted form of a man; his hollow
and unshaven face making an unsightly spectacle against
the not too clean pillow on which it lay.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was sleeping, and a woman, scarcely less wretched
in appearance, sat in a broken chair by his side, her elbows
resting upon her knees, and her head bowed upon her hands.
A small, cracked stove, upon which there was a broken-nosed
tea-kettle, was the only other piece of furniture in the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” whispered Milly, as soon as Editha had entered
and she had closed the door, “here is a lady who says she
will help us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl passed lightly over the floor and stood by the
woman’s side, placing one hand on her shoulder to attract
her attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>She lifted her haggard face in a bewildered way, and gazed
with a vacant stare first upon her child, then upon Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help!” she muttered, her hands working nervously. “We’ll
need help soon, or——”</p>

<p class='c007'>A shudder finished the sentence more impressively than
words could have done, and then, without taking any further
notice of her strange visitor, she relapsed into her
former indifference and position.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was appalled at what she saw. She had not
dreamed of such misery as this, and her face grew white
and grave with sorrow and pity. Drawing her purse from
her pocket, she took a bill from it with eager, trembling
fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Milly,” she said, in a low tone, pressing it into her hand,
“go quickly and get something with which to make a fire and
something to eat; you know what you need better than I
can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words were scarcely uttered when the child’s thin
fingers clutched the money, and with a smothered cry of
thankfulness, she was gone like a flash of light.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha then turned her attention to the mother. Going
to her side, she touched her gently on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My poor woman,” she said, kindly, “how long have you
been like this?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>She looked up again, with the same vacant stare as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” she said, in hollow tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha repeated her question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve had no fire for a week, miss,” she said, with an
effort to arouse herself; “but it hasn’t been quite so bad until
to-day, for the sun comes in at the window when it’s pleasant,
and we could sit in that and keep comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Comfortable!</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha thought of the cheerful fire in her grate at home,
while the house was also heated from attic to cellar with
steam, and her heart smote her painfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And have you absolutely <em>nothing</em> to eat?” she asked,
her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have not been entirely without food until to-day; we
ate our last penny’s worth of bread yesterday,” the woman
answered, with a deep-drawn sigh, and, from her manner
of speaking, Editha instinctively knew that at some previous
time in her life she had known “better days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has your husband been ill long?” she asked, with a glance
toward the ghastly sleeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two or three months; he had a bad fall awhile ago,
and lay out in the rain and cold for several hours. The
fall strained him, and that, with the cold he took, threw
him into a quick consumption. He will live only a few days
longer,” she concluded, with a sigh. “But how do <em>you</em>
happen to be here?” she asked a moment after, with a stare
of surprise at Editha’s rich garments. It had but just come
to her that she was entertaining a very unusual guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I met your daughter in the street, and she told me of
your suffering; so I came to see what I could do for you,”
was the gentle answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor Milly!” the woman sighed, and then, seeming to
be overcome by stupor, fell back into her former position.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was so weakened by hunger, and cold, and the fatigue
of watching, that she was scarcely conscious of Editha’s
presence, and had answered her questions in a mechanical
sort of way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ere long a quick, light step sounded on the stairs, and the
next moment Milly entered, bearing a basket of coal in one
hand, a pail and two or three packages in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, mother, come quick,” she said, in an eager whisper;
“help me make a fire and warm broth for father. I got it
’round the corner at the oyster-house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had deposited her burdens in the middle of the floor,
and was down upon her knees before the warped and cracked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>stove before she had ceased speaking, nimbly yet quietly
laying the kindlings, which in another instant she kindled,
and a cheerful roar and crackling sounded through the
room, giving promise of warmth and comfort ere long.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the sweetest music we’ve heard for a month, isn’t
it mother?” Milly said, in a cheery whisper; and Mrs.
Loker, as if aroused by the unaccustomed sound, arose and
dragged her weary steps across the floor toward where she
sat.</p>

<p class='c007'>But her strength was exhausted before she reached her,
and she sank down beside the stove, helpless and nearly
fainting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Milly, meanwhile, had produced a candle from somewhere,
which she lighted and set upon the mantel over the stove.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drink a little of this, mother,” the child said, springing
to her and putting the pail to her blue lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman eagerly grasped it and swallowed a few mouthfuls
of the oyster broth which it contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor mother!” Milly said, pityingly. “I know you feel
as if the bottom had dropped out of your stomach. I did,
and I <em>couldn’t</em> help nibbling just a little on the way home.
Now eat this;” and she broke off a mouthful of soft roll
and gently forced it into Mrs. Loker’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the saddest sight that the delicate and daintily-bred
Editha Dalton had ever seen in her life; and she could
only stand there and weep silently, while she watched that
hungry child feeding her starving mother with tender, loving
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do pearls and diamonds never grow heavy with the weight
of poverty’s tears? Does the rustle of satins and silks never
whisper of hunger-moans? Do those rare and ghost-like
laces, wrought with the cunning device, and worth their
weight in gold, never oppress the hearts of the fair women
who wear them?—are they never burdened with the sighs
of those whose scant covering scarcely conceals their nakedness,
and much less serves as a protection against the chilling
blasts of winter, and whom it would take the price of but one
single yard of that delicate lace to feed, and warm, and
clothe?</p>

<p class='c007'>Will the gratification of pride, and the wilful extravagance
of which these things are the result, afford any satisfaction
when, at the last call, the rich and the poor must
meet on equal ground, and one shall say: “I was an hungered
and ye gave me no meat, I was athirst and ye gave me
no drink, naked and ye clothed me not, sick and in prison and
ye visited me not?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Something of all this flitted through Editha Dalton’s mind
as, standing in that wretched room, she witnessed the heart-rending
scene already described, and, with a silent prayer
that God would strengthen her purpose, she resolved that
henceforth her charities should be increased fourfold.</p>

<p class='c007'>A genial warmth began to pervade the room, a gentle
simmering sound came from the pail upon the stove, and
an appetizing smell as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman, gaining strength from the nourishment she
had taken, and also feeling cheered and refreshed, arose and
assisted her child to prepare something for the husband and
father.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sick man now stirred and coughed feebly, then, becoming
aware that something unusual was transpiring, he
opened his sunken eyes and looked around.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first object they rested upon was Editha, who had
turned toward him when he moved, and who looked like
some fair, beautiful creature from another sphere, as she
was standing there with the flickering light falling full upon
her face, her golden hair, and rich robes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man no sooner saw her than an expression of recognition
and fear stole over his features.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has come! She has hunted me down at last!” he
cried, in hollow tones, and shrinking further down in the
bed, but with his eyes still fastened as if by magnetism upon
Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father,” cried Milly, cheerfully, “I’ll have something nice
for you in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no; don’t let them take me away to jail; I ain’t able
to go to prison,” he moaned, feebly, and trembling as if
with fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>His wife hastened to his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, John; no one shall disturb you or harm you,” she
said, soothingly. “His mind is weak, ma’am, when he first
wakes,” she continued, turning to Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my mind isn’t weak,” the man replied, impatiently.
“I know her, and she’s found me out at last;” and, raising
his emaciated hand, he pointed with one long, bony finger at
their visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John, be quiet. You do not know the lady; she is a
stranger, who came with Milly to help us,” returned his wife,
trying to quiet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s found me out at last,” he repeated, his eyes still
fixed upon Editha. “She’s the rich chap’s girl, whose house
we—Tom Drake and I—cracked three or four years ago.
She was asleep when we went into her room and stole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>her trinkets; but she looked so beautiful that I’ve never forgotten
her face. I tried to make Tom leave her bracelets
and rings, but he wouldn’t. It’s Miss Dalton, Maria,
and I tell you she’s come to send me to prison.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='large'>JOHN LOKER’S CONFESSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The man had risen on his elbow, and was staring with
the most abject fear at Editha, trembling and shivering until
his teeth chattered in his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>His mind evidently was very weak—so weak that, under
the influence of the sudden shock caused by seeing the
young girl, he was babbling of secrets which otherwise he
would never have dared to betray.</p>

<p class='c007'>His first words had caused Editha only surprise, but as
he went on her heart gave a sudden, wild bound that for
the moment turned her giddy and faint.</p>

<p class='c007'>She comprehended at once, when he spoke of having
“cracked” her father’s house and of taking her “trinkets,”
that she was in the presence of one who knew something
about, and doubtless had participated in, that robbery so long
ago, and for which crime Earle had so unjustly suffered. A
cry of thankfulness nearly escaped her lips at this almost
overwhelming knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle would be free at last—every taint would be obliterated,
and he could henceforth walk the earth as proudly
as the proudest.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the one thought that was uppermost in her mind
as she waited almost breathlessly for him to say more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see, miss,” his wife here interfered, turning a white,
anxious face to her, “he does not know what he is saying,
and he is getting very much excited. If—if—I thank you—I
<em>bless</em> you for your kindness and the comfort you have
brought us; but if you will please go away now while I quiet
him——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, Maria, you shall not send her away!” exclaimed
the sick man, growing more excited. “She shall stay now,
and I’ll tell her all about it, if she’ll only promise not to
send me to prison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one shall send you there, John,” Mrs. Loker tried
to say quietly, though Editha could see that she was very
much disturbed also.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>The opportunity was one that must not be lost, however.</p>

<p class='c007'>She felt that the man was dying—he could not live many
days; and if he knew anything that would clear Earle from
dishonor, she must discover it now.</p>

<p class='c007'>She walked quickly and softly to his bedside, and, speaking
very kindly, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Loker, do not be disturbed. I promise you that no
harm shall come to you, and you shall have every comfort
as long as you live, if you can prove to me that what you
have just stated is true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her tones were so gentle, and her eyes so mild and kind,
that he was instantly reassured.</p>

<p class='c007'>He fell back upon his pillow, panting for breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you hear, Maria? She says—no harm shall—come.
I’ve dreamed—of her for weeks—as she lay there sleeping—so
innocent—and—beautiful—while—we stole her treasures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, John, <em>please</em>,” whispered his wife, greatly distressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Maria; I want to tell her all about it now. It <em>is</em>
Miss Dalton, isn’t it?” and he scanned her face eagerly, as
if he feared he might possibly have made a mistake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I am Miss Dalton; and, if you are able, I want you
to tell me all about the night of which you speak,” Editha
answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d have been glad to confess it then, rather than let
that fine young fellow go to prison,” he continued, with a
deep sigh; “but Tom declared he’d kill me if I peached, and
so I—had to hold my tongue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused for breath, and Mr. Loker, turning beseechingly
to Editha, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss, I cannot bear him to run on so. Won’t you <em>please</em>
go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Editha was determined she would not. Here she had,
in the strangest manner imaginable, stumbled across one of
the burglars who had so successfully committed a great
robbery and then escaped punishment, while another had paid
the penalty; and she was resolved to learn the whole story
now, if such a thing was possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the man should die without confessing the guilt that
seemed to lie so heavy on his conscience, all possibility of
clearing Earle from suspicion and restoring his fair fame
would be forever lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>She disliked to give the suffering woman pain, but Earle’s
character was dearer to her than aught else, and it would
be a cruel wrong to him to heed her request and go.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The man was evidently anxious to confess his guilt; it
lay heavy on his heart. He doubtless knew he could not
live long, and he desired to make a clean breast of everything
before he should die.</p>

<p class='c007'>No, she must stay and learn what she could; but first
she felt that the sufferer ought to have some nourishment;
he was already much exhausted from his recent excitement,
and his strength would not hold out unless he could first
have something to eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha went to Milly and assisted her to prepare the broth,
which was already warm, and the child then, with grateful
thanks, took it to him and fed him with her own hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>He eagerly took all she gave him as if he also was nearly
famished, and then seized the soft roll which she had in her
hand, eating it with evident relish.</p>

<p class='c007'>His hunger satisfied, he beckoned Editha again to his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How came you here to-night, Miss Dalton?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>She explained how it had happened, and he muttered, half
to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes, I see; you were sent here that justice might at
last be done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“John,” pleaded his wife anxiously, “you are not strong
enough to talk any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shrank from the disgraceful confession she saw he had
determined to make.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maria, you keep still,” he returned, with some show
of impatience; “you know how heavy this thing has lain on
my conscience ever since that youngster went to prison in
my stead; and now that fate has opened a way, I am going
to make it right, or as right as I can, if I die the next minute.
Miss Dalton cannot stand,” he added, with considerable
thoughtfulness; “let her have your chair, and you sit on the
bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In obedience to his request, Mrs. Loker arose from the
chair, but, instead of sitting upon the bed, she sank down
upon the floor beside it and buried her face in the clothes
with a groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha gladly took the seat thus vacated for her, for she,
too, was weak and trembling with excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you see that I cannot live long,” John Loker
said to her; and holding up his thin hand between his eyes
and the light, it looked almost transparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You look very ill, sir,” she answered, gently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s become of that young chap who was sentenced
for that robbery?” he demanded, abruptly, after a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“He is in Europe now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had true grit in him; he never winced nor showed the
white feather once during the trial,” he said, in an admiring
tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know?” Editha asked, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom Drake and I sat by and heard the whole thing
through.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did?” she cried out in pain. “How could you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Only to think of it—the real criminals so near to justice
and Earle convicted instead! It was horrible!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we heard the case clear through; we heard the
sentence passed upon him; and he stood up so proud, and
calm, and handsome, and bore it without a whimper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How could you?” Editha again asked, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know, Miss Dalton, but folks get hardened to
almost anything nowadays,” he replied, sighing. “It was
cheeky, risky business for us to sit there, with some of
those very diamonds and trinkets hidden away on our persons,
and let another man be tried for what we had done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha shuddered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must confess,” he went on, “that I never felt so mean
in all my life as when I saw him turn white about the mouth
when the jury brought in their verdict; and then, when
you jumped up so brave and eager, and declared he <em>was
not guilty</em>, I was so near confessing the whole thing that
Tom laid a heavy hand on me and told me, with a look in
his eye that meant business, that he’d kill me on the spot
if I made so much as a sign. Of course, I did not dare
to move after that,” he went on, with a deprecating look
into the fair girl’s reproachful eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there is such a thing as turning State’s evidence.
Couldn’t you have done that, and then, if this other one
was more guilty than you, he would have suffered the penalty,
and you would have gone free?” Editha asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought of that, miss, and I know Tom suspected me,
too, for he dogged me all the time; and then, I’d been
entangled in so many other things, I should probably have
got deeper into the mire. We reasoned that they would be
easy with the young chap—he’d only have a short sentence—when,
if they’d caught us, we’d have had ten or fifteen
years for being old hands at the business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a wicked, cruel thing to do, to let an innocent man
suffer as he suffered!” Editha exclaimed, forgetting for a
moment, in her indignation, that she was speaking to a dying
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it—I see it now, miss, and I’ve been afraid to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>die with that on my mind; perhaps, if I confess the whole,
I shall feel easier. I’ll tell you the whole story, if you like,”
he returned, humbly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, do,” she cried, eagerly. “It can do no harm to confess
it now, and will be an act of justice to the innocent—it
will clear Mr. Wayne from the disgrace that otherwise must
always rest upon him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wayne! Yes, that was his name. What was the other?
It was a sort of high-sounding one, if I remember right,” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle Wayne was the name,” Editha replied, with a rising
flush as she pronounced it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether it was “high-sounding” or not, it was the dearest
name in all the world to her, and she could not speak it without
a thrill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was a particular friend o’ yours, wan’t he?” he inquired,
with, a quick, searching look into the glowing face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but I’m ready to hear your story now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not deem it at all necessary to enter into the particulars
of her relationship with Earle for his benefit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, as you say, it can do no harm to confess it now,
and Tom Drake can’t hurt me, either—nobody will dare
touch a dying man, though he did swear he’d kill me if I
ever lisped a word of it. I know he meant what he said;
and, miss, though I’ve been <em>driven</em> to stealing for a living,
yet I’ve always <em>loved</em> my wife and child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused abruptly and glanced at those two faithful ones—the
<em>only</em> ones in all the world who cared that he was dying,
and who would miss him when he was dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s been torture to me lately,” he went on, with emotion,
“to see them going cold and hungry, taking the bread from
their own mouths to keep life a little longer in my worthless
body; but, miss, folks that are down in the world and driven
into a corner can <em>love</em> just as strong as those who never knew
a want.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, I do not doubt it,” Editha said, feeling a deep pity
for him, notwithstanding he had so deeply injured one whom
<em>she</em> so fondly loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it is but adding insult to injury; but, miss, if you—if
I could only be assured they need not want for bread when
I am gone, it would be a great comfort,” he added, with a
wistfulness that brought the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They shall not—I promise you that I will see that they do
not suffer,” she said, heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not deserve it from you, Miss Dalton, after using <em>him</em>
so,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>He seemed to have an intuitive idea of how matters stood
between her and Earle, and her kindness moved him deeply;
and Editha just then heard a smothered sob from the woman
kneeling beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you a pencil and a piece of paper about you?”
John Loker asked, after resting a few moments. “I want
you to write down what I am going to tell you, and then
I will sign it. It will be a strange ‘last will and testament,’”
he added, with a bitter smile; “but perhaps it will
do as much good as if I left a large fortune.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha thought it would, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, she had a pencil, and there was some paper in her
French book that she had taken to write an exercise on and
had not used. She produced these, and, using her books
for a table, she was ready to write down the confession that
would secure to her betrothed an unspotted name and place
him where no man’s scorn would dare assail him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX<br> <span class='large'>THE FACE AT THE WINDOW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll give you a description of Tom Drake first, so you will
not fail to know him if you should ever see him,” John Loker
said, when Editha motioned him to begin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a scamp, if there ever was one abroad in the world,
and it would be a good thing for the public if he should
yet have to serve a term of years somewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a tall, broad-shouldered, burly-looking man, with
an ugly face on him, square, heavy jaws, and fierce black
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His hair is red, too—something you don’t often see with
black eyes. There is a piece gone, too, from the lobe of
his left ear, where he was once shot by a policeman, and
came near losing his life. He has a scar under his right
eye, and the little finger on his left hand is missing; that
was done in blowing open a safe at one time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha did not think she could fail to know him after
this description, and she already felt a sort of creeping horror
in her veins as in her mind’s eye she saw this dreadful
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, miss,” the invalid continued, “about that robbery;
we’d planned to do the thing—or, rather, he’d planned it all,
and I was to help do the dirty work, a long, long time before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>we found a chance to carry it out. We’d got all the bearings,
and knew just how every room in the house lay before we
ever entered it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On that night—it was cloudy and dark, if you remember—Tom
cut out a pane of glass from one of the area
windows with a diamond he has on purpose, while I watched
to see that no one was around.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We then easily entered by that window, and made as
short work as possible of clearing out everything of value
that we could lay our hands on in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was about the neatest and most profitable job that was
ever done in a private house, and not a soul awoke through
it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There were the silver spoons and gold-lined salt-cellars,
and a lot of other stuff in the china closet out of the dining-room,
all clean, solid silver, too. We cracked the safe in
the library, and, though we did not get much money, we got
a lot of diamonds belonging to your mother, miss, like
enough, and then we went upstairs to see what we could find
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t much mind taking the things we found below;
I’d got hardened to stealing a good while before that; but
when we came to your room where you lay asleep, looking
so innocent and pretty, with all that soft stuff ruffled round
your neck and wrists, my heart failed me, for I thought
of Milly here, whom I suppose I love just as well as rich
folks love their children, and I knew just how she’d have
loved all the pretty things we saw laying about you. I
begged Tom to leave your rings and trinkets, and knick-knacks,
but he growled at my nonsense and grabbed everything
he could lay his hands upon, holding the lantern and
revolver all the while.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Once I thought what should I do if you awoke and found
us there. And, miss, I’d have shot him, bad as I was myself,
and about as much to blame for that dirty business, before I
would have let him lay so much as a finger upon you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sick man was here seized with a violent fit of coughing,
which so exhausted him that it was some time before he
could resume his confession again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha beckoned Milly to bring him some more of the
warm broth, which she did, and this appearing to revive
him, he was soon able to go on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you got all I have told you written down?” he asked,
glancing at the paper in her lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, everything,” Editha answered.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>She had had ample time to do so, for he was obliged to
stop every little while to rest and recover his breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right,” he said; “don’t leave out anything, for
I must make a clean breast of it all, now that I have begun;
and, miss, if the thing can be done, I want that handsome
young chap—and he’s a lawyer, I hear—to bring Tom
Drake to justice, for a bigger rascal does not walk the
earth. Why, miss, if you will believe me, he pocketed all
the swag, and I never got so much as a penny’s worth of
it for my share in that night’s job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I thought you told me that you wore it concealed
upon your person at the time of Mr. Wayne’s trial?” Editha
said, regarding him in surprise, and thinking his statements
did not correspond very well.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so we did, miss—the diamonds—we didn’t dare
hide them with the other stuff, for fear they might happen
to be found, and so they were sewed into the lining of our
vests; but after awhile Tom said he’d found a chance to
send them off and turn them into money, and took those
I had away from me. I’ve never seen anything of them
since—he never would tell me whether he had sold them
or not, and I’ve never had a dollar for my share in that
job. I was raving mad over it, until I had that fall, and
then since I’ve been sick and had a chance to think it all
over, I’ve been glad that I didn’t get anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The invalid was here interrupted by another coughing
turn, and, while Editha was waiting for it to pass, she happened
to cast her eye toward the window back of the bed,
and there a sight greeted her that seemed to stop the beating
of her heart, and freeze the blood in her veins, and a
numbness seized her limbs, rendering her powerless to move
for the time being. It was the face of a man—and <em>such</em> a
face!—pressed close against the pane, and his ear—<em>an ear
with part of the lobe gone</em>—covering a small hole in the
glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a “burly-looking man,” with an “ugly face” on
him, “heavy jaws,” and “fierce,” restless “black eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His hair, too, was red, and—there could be but one person
in the world answering to that description.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an instant—in that one flash of her eyes, Editha had
recognized Tom Drake, the burglar and midnight robber!</p>

<p class='c007'>How long had he been there? How much had he heard,
and did he recognize her as John Loker had done? were
the thoughts that flashed through her brain during that brief
moment that her quick, startled glance rested upon that
appalling sight. Her first impulse was to cry out with fright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>but with an effort she controlled it, and glanced hastily at
the other occupant of her room, to see whether they were
in any danger of also discovering the presence of the listener.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was glad to find that she alone was conscious of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Milly, overcome by the genial warmth after her exposure
to the cold, and also by the effective quietus of a full stomach,
had fallen asleep by the stove, her head resting against
the side of the house, while Mrs. Loker still kept her motionless
position by the bedside, her head buried in the clothes;
whether she also was asleep or not, Editha could not tell,
but she earnestly hoped she was, for she feared, she knew
not what, if the man at the window should become aware
that his presence was discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The window was at the head of the bed; so, of course, the
invalid was wholly unconscious of, and in no danger of
knowing, that he had another listener to his confession.
The man himself, Editha thought, had not seen her glance
that way, for his ear had been laid against the hole in the
glass, and he appeared to be listening intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the first excess of fright had passed the stagnated
blood rushed through her veins in a swift torrent, sending
sharp, tingling pains throughout her whole body, until it
seemed as if she was literally swathed in nettles.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she gave no outward sign. Her thoughts flew to Earle,
her manly lover across the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>She held in her hands the evidence which, a little more
complete, and signed by the man before her, would vindicate
his honor and restore him the respect and confidence
of all who knew him.</p>

<p class='c007'>So she resolved to sit quietly there until this was accomplished,
though she wondered if her weak and trembling
fingers would be able to hold the pencil and trace the words
that yet remained to be spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not even dare to consider how she was to get
home in the fast gathering gloom with that precious paper
in her possession; she did not dare to think whether that
dreadful creature outside would allow her to leave that
place and carry with her the evidence that would serve to
doom him to a felon’s cell for a long and tedious term of
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>She only found herself wondering how he had attained
his position at that window, for she knew they were in the
second story of the building, and it seemed a marvel to
her that he should be there at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had he seen and recognized her while she was talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>with Milly outside, and then, fearing what would follow,
obtained a ladder and climbed to the window?</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a puzzle to her, but she did not know of the low
building attached to the house, and which rendered it very
easy for any one to climb and look in upon that poverty-stricken
family within.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither could she know that it had of late been a custom
with that wicked man to go there every few nights to
see how fast the only person in the world who knew his dread
secrets was dying.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Drake longed to be rid of the accomplice who knew
so much of his evil course, and whom he constantly feared
would turn against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had heard that day that John Loker was dying, and,
determined to see for himself how near he was to his end,
he had, as soon as the darkness favored him, climbed to
his usual post.</p>

<p class='c007'>His consternation can be better imagined than described
as he beheld and recognized Editha Dalton, of all persons
in the world the last one he expected to find there, sitting
by the dying man’s bedside, writing the confession that
branded him the thief and robber that he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Editha, notwithstanding that every nerve in her body
was vibrating with pain from her startling discovery still
sat there, apparently calm and unmoved, waiting to hear
the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>She even turned in her chair a little at last, as if carelessly
changing her position.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was done with a purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was afraid if she sat directly opposite that window
the magnetism and fascination, horrible though it was, of
that terrible face and those fierce eyes, which affected her as
face and eyes had never done before, would irresistibly draw
her glance in that direction and betray her knowledge of the
presence there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, miss,” the sick man resumed at length—and the
sound of his voice breaking the silence that had been so
fraught with horror to her sent a painful shock through
her whole being—“we got out of the house with our booty,
which we carried in a bag, without disturbing any one, and
we were congratulating ourselves that we had done a wonderful,
neat and profitable job, when, just as we came around
the corner by the front entrance, a young chap pounced out
upon us and felled Tom to the ground with a swinging,
unexpected blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He then came for me as brave as a young giant, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>grappled with him. He gave me a tough struggle of it, I can
tell you; but, I knew the boxing game better than he, and it
wasn’t long before I had him laid out as flat as a flounder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did it just in the nick of time, too, for a ‘cop’ having
got wind that something wrong was up, came running down
the street; so I just dropped a bracelet, which Tom had
made me stuff in my pocket, down beside the fallen hero,
to turn the scent upon him, and took to my heels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom served me a mean trick, though,” the man went
on, with a scowl, “for he had only been slightly stunned
by his fall, and while I was fighting with the young chap,
instead of coming to my help, he picked up the bag, cleared
out and hid it, and it was only a piece of good luck that I
got off at all. He said afterwards he thought I was able to
take care of myself, and he was afraid if he did not slip
off with the booty the noise of the rumpus would bring a cop
along, and we’d lose it all. But he’d got it hid before I found
him, and I never saw anything of it afterward, excepting
the diamonds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I coaxed, begged and threatened, but he kept putting me
off with excuses; and, of course, I’d been with him so much
in his dirty work that he knew I would not dare turn against
him, for I should only get as deep into the mire as he would.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As long as I was well, and able to help him in his plots,
I managed to squeezed enough out of him to keep us tolerably
comfortable; but after I got sick we all began to suffer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Dalton,” the man said, excitedly, “Tom Drake is a
rich man; he’s got money and swag enough hid up to keep
a dozen families handsome all their lives. Why, those diamonds
o’ your mother’s were a fortune in themselves, and
we’ve been starving and freezing here for the last two
months; <em>he’s known it, too</em>, and wouldn’t give us a dime
to buy a loaf of bread with.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am dying now; <em>he</em> can’t harm me, and the <em>law</em> can’t
touch me, and I’ve outwitted him at last; his meanness is
half that’s made me want to show him up, and if you will
only bring him to justice, you’ll do the world a favor, besides
clearing that fine young chap, who was as brave as
a lion, from disgrace; for I tell you Tom Drake is one of the
worst robbers in the United States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused, and Editha thought he had got through. She
hoped he had, for she felt she could not sit there much
longer; it was as much as she could do to keep in her chair
and feel that that fearful face, with those fierce, restless
black eyes, was looking down upon her, watching her every
movement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>But the invalid resumed, after resting a moment:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We, Tom and me, went to court every day while the
youngster was being tried for the robbery we had committed;
and we thought it fine fun that the scent had been so completely
turned from us to him. It was as clear a case of
circumstantial evidence as I ever heard of, and many’s the
joke we’ve cracked at that poor fellow’s expense. But,
miss, I must confess I’ve had mighty uncomfortable dreams
over it since lying here sick, and thinking of him locked in
behind those bolts and bars for three long years, and he as
innocent as a baby all the time, and we abroad doing more
of the devil’s work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He really appeared deeply moved, and Editha knew that
he must have suffered on account of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve been a bad man,” he continued with a sigh of regret,
“and I suppose I’ll get my deserts where I’m going; but I
know I shall deserve it all, whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you written everything just as I’ve told you?” he
asked again, anxiously, turning his sunken eyes upon the
closely written sheets in her lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I have everything correct, I think,” Editha answered,
longing to know if that dreadful face was still glaring
upon them, yet not daring to look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then give me the pencil and hold the paper while I sign
it. I want this business off my mind; then perhaps I’ll feel
easier,” he said, eagerly, and holding out his thin hand for
the pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha placed it between his fingers, and then holding her
books with the paper laid on them so that he could write,
he laboriously scrawled beneath what she had already written:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I swear that this is the living truth.      <span class='sc'>John Loker.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” Editha said, with a breath of relief, hastily
folding the paper, and wondering where and how she should
hide it from those fierce, restless eyes above her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She ventured to flash one swift glance out of the corners
of her eyes toward the window, and, to her intense relief,
she found that there was nothing there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Drake had disappeared as silently and as suddenly
as he had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>But her heart instinctively told her that that was not the
last of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps he was even now hiding somewhere near, waiting
to pounce upon her when she should go out of that wretched
place, and wrest that precious confession from her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>But he should not have it—he <em>must not</em> have it; she would
make a bold fight, frail woman though she was, before she
would yield up the only thing in the world that would clear
her betrothed lover’s name from dishonor.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had one hope, else her courage would have failed her
utterly—the policeman whom she had asked to have a care
for her safety and who had been so civil to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she had been gone much longer than she had told
him she would be, and possibly he had become tired of waiting
for her and gone away.</p>

<p class='c007'>A tumult of thoughts like these filled her mind and nearly
bewildered her, but above and over all was a stern determination
never to part with that paper until all the world should
know of its contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Convinced that the face no longer glared upon her, she
slipped it within her bosom and buttoned her dress close
over it. Then she arose to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, she could not bear to leave that dying man, perhaps
never to see him alive again, without a few comforting
words. His own last words had told her that he feared
the future—that he dreaded to go forth into the great and
mysterious eternity, and she longed to give him a little cheer,
even though she knew that every moment’s delay but increased
her own danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must leave you now,” she said, gently, and bending
nearer to him, a great pity shining in her lovely face; “and
I thank you more than I can tell you for the act of justice
that you have at last done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank <em>you</em>, miss,” he said, feebly, and with quivering
lips, “for being so kind and gentle to me, and I hope you’ll
forgive me as well for my share in that night’s business,”
he concluded, humbly.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Could</em> she forgive it?</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s heart gave a little startled leap at the humble
request. She could readily forgive the robbery, and the
loss of so much that was valuable; but could she forgive the
wrong done to Earle? Could she ever overlook those long,
weary days of suffering which he had borne—the scorn,
insult, and abuse heaped upon him, and the disgrace which
had followed him ever since?</p>

<p class='c007'>But he was to be free from it all at last. To be sure,
those years could not be given back to him, but all other
fetters were to drop from him. She held the key that was
to unlock them, and John Loker, the man now asking so
meekly for pardon, had given it to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The divine words came to her like a message of light.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I do forgive you,” she said, sweetly; “and God will
forgive you even more freely, and take away all the dread
you have of the future, if you ask Him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you <em>again</em>, miss; those are <em>good</em> words,” he said,
with a sigh of relief and thankfulness that she had forgiven
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And cannot you believe them,” she asked—“that God will
forgive you, too?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook his head wearily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My mother used to teach me about God when I was a
boy, but I’ve forgotten Him, and been bad for so long, that
I guess I ain’t of much account to Him now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pathos with which he said it, and the look of stony
despair in his eyes, made Editha’s heart ache for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you not regret that your life has been so full of
wrong, and such a failure?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed, miss,” he replied, earnestly; “I’m bitter sorry,
and I’ve thought it all over and over again the long nights
I’ve had to lie awake here with the cough, but I couldn’t
see any way out of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Jesus</em> is the way, the truth, and the light,” came involuntarily
from Editha’s lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’ve heard that more times than I can count, but
I can’t understand it, some way,” he said, with a perplexed
look.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha sighed.</p>

<p class='c007'>What could she say to comfort him? And the thought
came to her that, after all, she would rather be in Earle’s
place, who had patiently and innocently suffered a great
wrong, even though the cloud which now overshadowed him
should never be dissipated until that day when all things
shall be revealed, than to be lying here like this guilty one,
upon the borders of eternity, with no hope beyond, even
though his life of sin had escaped all worldly chastisement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you were in some dark and dangerous place,” she
said again, and speaking very slowly and earnestly, “and
I should tell you to take my hand, for I knew the way,
and would lead you safely out, would you refuse to do as
I asked you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Truth, no, miss; and you would not have to ask me
more than once, either. But the future is mighty dark to
me, and <em>you</em> can’t lead me through <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but the Friend of sinners can.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“<em>Friend</em> of sinners!” he repeated, feebly. “That sounds
pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is just what Jesus Christ is,” Editha answered,
eagerly. “Put your hand in His; it is always held out to all
who <em>need</em> help; and He will lead you safely out of all danger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another deep-drawn sigh was all the reply she received
to this; and, after waiting a moment, she said again:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must not stay longer now, but I will come and see you
again soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll not find me here, miss, I fear,” he said, with a
wistful look at her, as if to see her again would do him
good; “but <em>they’ll</em> be here, and you have said you’ll be good
to them,” indicating by a glance his wife and child, who were
both now heavily sleeping.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I will see that they are made comfortable, and I
will leave this, so that if you need anything you can send
Milly for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha put a five-dollar note in his wasted hand as she
spoke, and then, with a kind good-night to him, she aroused
his wife, after which she went away alone into the dark and
dismal night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX<br> <span class='large'>MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was quite dark in the street, she found, when she had
groped her way down the rickety stairs to it, and a fine,
chill rain was falling.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a wildly beating heart, and dilating, frightened eyes,
Editha looked up and down the sidewalk, hoping to catch
sight of the friendly policeman again. But he was nowhere
to be seen, and there were very few people to be either
seen or heard, every one who was fortunate enough to have
a shelter having sought its protection against the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drawing her cloak closer about her, and calling all her
resolution to her aid, she sped her way, half expecting that
at every step some horrible creature would rise up and
confront her, demanding the precious treasure that lay so
close above her fluttering heart. But no such person was
in sight, and no one appeared to be following her; and, gaining
courage from the fact, she grew more calm, and began
to breathe more freely, as she almost flew over the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had nearly gained a more public street, where she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>could see the friendly lights glimmering and beckoning her
on, and where, once reached, she intended taking a car home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her courage arose with every step; she had only one more
low, ill-looking building to pass, then an open space, before
she would be where no possible harm could come to her.
Her heart beat lightly and cried out within her: “Victory!
victory!” for now Earle would be free from all taint or
suspicion—he could hereafter proudly face the whole world,
and no one would dare to point the finger of scorn at him
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>How happy she would be to be able to give him this evidence
when he should return. She had never dared to think
that <em>she</em> would be the one to bestow upon him such exceeding
joy, and she hugged to her bosom with a strange feeling of
exultation the closely-penciled paper that was to accomplish
all this.</p>

<p class='c007'>The low building was nearly passed—two minutes more
and she would be——</p>

<p class='c007'>Safe! she would have added; but a sudden shock prevented
her ever finishing the interrupted thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>A heavy hand dropped upon her shoulder like the stroke
of a hammer, and a fierce voice whispered in her ear:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make no noise and I will do you no harm; scream <em>once</em>,
and I’ll choke you; but I must have that paper that John
Loker signed for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew the instant she felt the touch of that hand—before
even a word was uttered—<em>who</em> it was that had captured
her there in the darkness and rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not need the aid of a light to know that a burly
head, with flaming red hair, and an ugly face, with a scar
under the right eye, and an ear with part of the lobe gone,
towered above her; she could almost <em>feel</em> that the hand
lying so heavily upon her was minus a portion of the little
finger, and a shudder ran through her as it flashed upon
her how much of crime that hand was guilty of, and might
be stained even more deeply, yet, before it should be removed
from her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sudden shock seemed to paralyze her for the moment,
so that she was powerless to resist. She <em>could</em> not have cried
out, even if his threat had not intimidated her, so terrible was
the fright she sustained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do you no injury, Editha Dalton; but I must have
that paper; and be quick about it, too,” the man repeated,
in low tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Give up that precious paper voluntarily—that treasure
worth more to her than her whole fortune! Give up all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the evidence there was in the world that Earle Wayne was
an innocent, injured, and long-suffering man!</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Never!</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Her whole soul arose at once to arms to do valiant battle
for the noble lover and his honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been fearful and trembling all the way from John
Loker’s house to this spot, dreading every step lest she
should meet this very foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that the danger was encountered, and she, a frail,
delicate girl, was actually in the power of a desperate villain,
and not a person within hearing to help her, she grew suddenly
calm, her brain clear, and quick, and keen to think,
her nerves steady to act.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know that I have any paper signed by
John Loker?” she quietly demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew well enough how, but she asked the question
to gain time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man laughed a short, scornful laugh; then he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a brave little woman, and a good actress;” and
there was a note of admiration in his voice as he spoke.
“You thought I did not see you glance up at the window back
of John Loker’s bed half an hour ago,” he went on, in quick,
low tones; “you did not scream nor make any fuss, as most
women would have done on seeing a face like mine peering
in upon them; you knew it was your only chance to get the
evidence that would clear an innocent man from the suspicion
of a crime; you showed a plucky spirit, Miss Dalton,
to sit there and write so quietly, when you knew Tom
Drake’s ugly face was looking down upon you. But did you
think I would let you get away with that evidence? Not
much—my business is too profitable to be stopped by having
my likeness displayed to the world, even though it was taken
by a hand as pretty as yours. So make haste and pass it
over,” he said, not unkindly, for her dauntless spirit had
really inspired him with admiration for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>You cannot have it!</em>” Edith said, firmly, while she made
an effort to free herself from the grasp of her captor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next instant she would have screamed for help in
spite of his threat, but he, anticipating this, threw one
powerful arm around her slight form, placing his other
hand at the same time over her mouth, and, lifting her
from her feet as easily as if she had been a child, he carried
her within the shadow of a door-way in the low building
before referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once there, he sat her down upon her feet again, though
he still kept her mouth firmly covered with his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“<em>I’ve got to have it</em>, d’ye hear?” he said, fiercely; “if not
by fair means, why, then, by foul. I’ve no wish to harm
you, and if you’ll give it up <em>quietly</em> I’ll let you go; if you
won’t, it will be the worst for you, that’s all. Will you
give it up? Nod your head if you mean yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha could scarcely breathe, his hand was so heavily
pressed over her mouth and nostrils, and she was absolutely
powerless in the strong man’s grasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew she was at his mercy, but she knew also that
he could not get possession of her treasure without removing
his hand from her face, which would give her an advantage
over him, because she could call for help.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, instead of nodding her head as he had commanded
her to do, she resolutely signified her defiance by a decided
shake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man uttered a round oath at this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently he had not anticipated any such determined
resistance, and for a moment he appeared undecided what
to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to strangle what little life there is left in that
traitor out of him,” he muttered, angrily, referring to John
Loker.</p>

<p class='c007'>His sentence was hardly completed when he uttered a
suppressed howl.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s white teeth had suddenly closed over the fleshy
part of his palm with a force that made him cringe with
pain, and at the same time remove something of the pressure
over her mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking advantage of this, she threw back her head with
a violent motion and sent forth a shrill cry for help.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cry was her salvation, and help was nearer than either
of them thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>A quick, firm tread soon sounded upon the pavement, and
then the tall form of a policeman became visible close at
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain saw that his “game was up,” and that the
wisest thing for him to do would be to get out of the way,
and, with another fierce oath, he released his hold upon
his victim and beat a hasty and inglorious retreat, vowing
vengeance upon her in the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>With succor at hand, and the disappearance of her captor,
Editha’s courage and strength failed her utterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her nerves had received a terrible shock, for which she
of necessity had now to pay the penalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not faint, nor go into hysterics, nor make any
Other disturbance, but she clung in speechless terror and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>trembling to the sturdy policeman who had come to her
aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you hurt, miss? Did the villain <em>dare</em> to hurt you?”
he asked, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not much; but, oh, oh! he frightened me terribly,”
she whispered, shaking as with the ague, and her teeth chattering
audibly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor thing! poor thing! this is a bad place for such as
you to be in,” he answered, pityingly. “I thought to watch
for you,” he continued, “until you came out from John
Loker’s house, and then take you safely through this dismal
street; but there was a scrimmage down here apiece, and
I had to go. But I was a sort ’o looking for you as I came
along back, and I suspected at once that it was you when I
heard you cry out. Did the wretch steal anything from
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but he wanted something which he knew I had, and I
wouldn’t give it to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Wouldn’t</em>, eh?” repeated the policeman, with a little
chuckle at her spirit and resolute tone. “Should you know
him if you should ever meet him again?” he asked, presently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes,” Editha answered, with a shudder, feeling that
it would be impossible ever to forget that repulsive face
that had so startled her at the window in John Loker’s miserable
home.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was now beginning to recover her strength, and signified
her readiness to go on if her companion would accompany
her. She longed to get away from the dismal place,
and as if she would never dare enter a by-street again as
long as she lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man readily went with her to the next street, and
waited to see her safely seated in a car, and in less than
fifteen minutes she was once more in her own luxurious
home, heartily thankful for her escape from a ruffian’s power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton expressed some surprise at her being out so
late—remarked, with some indifference, that she looked pale,
and asked if she was not well, and then added that dinner
had been waiting for more than half an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>She simply replied that she was well, and regretted that
he should have waited dinner for her, but she had been
unavoidably detained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha Dalton knew that she must keep her own counsel
regarding that evening’s adventures.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time had come when she could not trust her dearest
interests in the hands of her father. She knew he would
have no sympathy with her regarding the confession she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>obtained and would oppose rather than aid her in making it
public to vindicate Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she had resolved to go to Mr. Felton, on the morrow,
put the precious evidence in his hands, and be guided by his
ever wise counsel.</p>

<p class='c007'>She retired to her own rooms as soon as dinner was dispatched,
and immediately set herself to work to make a careful
copy of John Loker’s confession to send to Earle. And
then, with something of the fear creeping over her that she
had experienced while in Tom Drake’s power, she looked
around for a safe place in which to hide the original. She
would not take it below and put in into the safe, for she knew
that burglars were not troubled nowadays about opening
such things, let them have ever so complicated a lock, and
she could not sleep until it was safely disposed of somewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>What</em> shall I do with it?” she said, with flushed cheeks
and anxious brow. “Something tells me I must <em>hide</em> it even
for to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No drawer with any common lock would be a safe place,
she reasoned—she could not keep it about her person, and
for a long time it was a matter that caused her much perplexity.
All at once her eyes lighted. In her jewel-box,
which was quite a large one, there was a raised velvet
cushion, with places on it for the different articles of jewelry
she was in the habit of wearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>This cushion was securely glued to the bottom of the box.
What omen of impending evil could have inspired Editha
with the idea that underneath this would be a safe place to
hide her evidence?</p>

<p class='c007'>She carefully pried it from the box, folded the papers just
to fit the bottom, then, pressing the cushions firmly back into
its place, she once more arranged her jewels in their accustomed
position, and then, apparently satisfied with her work,
she resumed her seat and began to write an account of her
adventures to her dear one across the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said that “coming events cast their shadows before;”
whether this be true or not, I cannot say, but one thing is
certain, and that is that it was <em>well</em> for Earle Wayne’s honor
that Editha Dalton was guided by her impressions to so
adroitly conceal John Loker’s confession just where she did
and just <em>when</em> she did.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning Editha did not make her appearance at
the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was something unusual, for the young girl had always
made it a point, even since Mrs. Dalton’s death, to be neatly
and attractively dressed and in her place opposite her father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>promptly every morning upon the ringing of the breakfast-bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton, angry at thus being obliged to wait two successive
meals for her, curtly ordered a servant to go and
awake her, and tell her he was waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl hastened to do his bidding, but soon returned,
with pale and affrighted face, saying that Miss Editha was
not in her chamber, her bed had not been occupied during
the night, and that both sitting-room and bedroom were
in the direst confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton, was of course, instantly alarmed at this
startling intelligence, and hastened at once to investigate the
matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found it was even worse than the girl had stated.
Drawers, boxes, and closets had been overturned and emptied
of their contents, and lay scattered in every direction upon
the floor, chairs, and bed. Clothing had been unfolded,
shaken out, and then thrown hastily aside; dresses were lying
over chairs, with their pockets turned inside out and rifled
of their contents. Editha’s costly writing-desk was overturned
upon the floor, her letters and papers scattered in
every direction; and then it was for the first time that Mr.
Dalton knew for a certainty of her correspondence with
Earle, for stooping down to pick up these letters, he had
gathered up with others those that the young man had
sent across the sea to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never had those beautiful rooms been in such dire confusion
before, and nothing seemed to be missing but Editha’s
jewelry, which had been taken from its box, and that was left
standing, empty and open, in its accustomed place, and a
very common hat and circular waterproof, which she had
been in the habit of wearing in stormy weather. Editha
herself was gone—that was evident, and no one appeared to
know when nor whither.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton was nearly stupefied at first, and the thought
flashed upon him that she might have fled to Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he soon dismissed this idea, for he knew her character
well enough to know that if she was bound to marry
Earle Wayne she would do it boldly, openly, and in defiance
of the whole world; moreover, she never would have
gone away voluntarily and left things in that style, taking
nothing with her for her own comfort or needs.</p>

<p class='c007'>No, it was a deep and incomprehensible mystery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Days and weeks were devoted to the search of her. Detectives
were employed, the police were notified, and advertisements
were inserted in all the leading papers, but all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>without avail; no clew could be gained as to the whereabouts
of the missing girl; and Mr. Dalton was at last left entirely
alone and desolate in his beautiful home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only one thing was discovered that seemed to have any
bearing on the matter, and that was her adventure with the
unknown ruffian after her visit to John Loker’s house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The policeman who had rescued her gave an account of
what he knew of the matter, and then Mr. Dalton went himself
to see the wretched family, thinking perhaps some further
information might be gleaned from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But John Loker had died the day following Editha’s visit
there, and after the funeral the family had disappeared, and
no one knew anything of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>To say that Mr. Dalton was not extremely distressed over
the strange affair would be very unjust to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He availed himself of every possible means to solve the
dreadful mystery; but, as we have already seen, he was an
utterly selfish man, and it was not in his nature to brood
over anything either troublesome or disagreeable; and the
source from which he at length drew consolation may perhaps
be revealed by the following soliloquy with himself,
as he sat one night in the library, considering the pros and
cons of the future:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If anything—ah—fatal—<em>should</em> have—happened to Editha—if
she should not be—<em>living</em>, her—fortune then will be—<em>mine</em>,
I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And even while he spoke a strange look settled over his
face, there was a queer quaver in his voice, and he was as
white as the immaculate tie which he wore about his neck.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI<br> <span class='large'>FATAL TRUST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Twenty-one or two years before our story opens there
resided in Richmond, one of the beautiful suburbs of London,
the Right Honorable Warrenton Fairfield Vance, Marquis of
Wycliffe, and who also possessed another title; but of that
more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was the eldest of the two children of a previous Warrenton
Fairfield Vance, whose strange will created so much
discussion and remark at the time of his death, several years
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were only two children, we have said, the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>marquis and his sister, who, although considerably younger
than himself, had married, very early in life, a man of literary
profession, though of a wealthy and respectable family—Tressalia
by name.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had one child, a son, Arthur Tressalia, and father of
the Paul Tressalia of our story.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arthur Tressalia died when his son Paul was only three
years of age, and his grandmother, the marquis’ sister,
two years afterward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old marquis’ will, before referred to, had entailed his
estates in a very peculiar and rather perplexing way.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were to descend to the eldest <em>legitimate</em> child of each
generation, be it son or daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>In case it should be a daughter, it was stated that, upon
her marriage, her husband would be obliged to assume the
family name, and so perpetuate the race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In case the eldest child died without issue, or gave birth
to an illegitimate child, the entail would be cut off from
that branch of the family and revert in the same way to
the eldest child.</p>

<p class='c007'>For instance, if the present Marquis of Wycliffe died without
legitimate issue, the estates, title, and name would descend
to his sister, Mrs. Tressalia, and her legitimate heirs, according
to the provisions of the will.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the event of an utter failure of legitimate issue, the
estates would fall to the crown, and the personal property
to the enrichment of several public charitable institutions
mentioned in the will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Marquis of Wycliffe, at the time we speak of in the
beginning of the chapter, had one child, a daughter, sixteen
years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not married until long after his sister, having
been disappointed by a heartless coquette when quite a young
man, before coming into his property, and for many years he
could not endure the thought of marriage. But he had at
length wedded a gentle, lovable girl of good family, and
she had given birth to this little daughter, and no more
children were granted them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been a great disappointment to the marquis that
this child was not a son; but the little Marion Vance was
a very beautiful and charming little piece of humanity, although
exceedingly high-spirited and wilful, as will be seen
ere long.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her mother had died when she was only twelve years
of age, after which she was left to the care of a not too
conscientious governess, who enjoyed her own ease and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>reading French novels more than she did the training of her
wild and rebellious pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the motherless girl was left to come up pretty much
after her own will, and it is not so much to be wondered
at that, with no wise and tender hand to guide, no warning
voice to chide, counsel, and direct, her future should
be planted with thorns, and that the life which gave promise
in its budding of so much beauty and joy should, in
the blooming, be marred and blighted by grave and fatal
mistakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the summer of Marion Vance’s sixteenth year
the marquis permitted her to visit some distant relatives
of the family living at Rye, near the sea, in South Sussex
County.</p>

<p class='c007'>These relatives consisted of father, mother, and four gay,
blooming daughters, the latter as full of fun and mischief
as the day is long; and no one was ever known, up to this
time, to visit the Surrey mansion and go away without regretting
the bright days that had flown all too quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said that Marion Vance was wilful, and a little
incident will serve to prove our assertion. Upon reaching
her destination on this eventful summer, the obstinate little
marchioness elect had insisted upon being introduced into
the society frequented by the Surrey family as plain Miss
Vance, devoid of either title or any particularly alluring
future prospects.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be so much happier not to be hampered with all
the forms and ceremonies that are so irksome at home, and
which papa is so tenacious of,” said the little lady, as she
persistently argued her point with the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am in doubt as to the propriety of such a proceeding
for that very reason—your papa would not approve,”
demurred Madam Surrey, disliking to refuse the bright girl’s
request, yet fearing even more to offend the marquis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, <em>please</em> let me be happy in my own way for a little
while. At home I am my Lady This and my Lady That,
until I hate the word, and long to get out of my straitjacket
and enjoy a little freedom,” sighed the fair pleader,
coaxingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no resisting the insinuating tones, the sweet
blue eyes, and the pretty, pouting mouth; so for eight short,
happy weeks the child of the aristocratic Marquis of Wycliffe
was simply Miss Marion Vance, and a merrier quintette than
those five—Kate, Ida, Caroline, and Isabel, with Marion—made
could not have been found elsewhere in all South Sussex
County.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The Honorable Andrew Surrey’s residence was a most
charming one, overlooking the sea, and that year it was
christened by the surrounding neighborhood “The Home of
the Nymphs,” in honor of the charming beauties residing
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>But dire calamity and sorrow were destined to overtake
these beautiful and careless nymphs ere their summer holiday,
begun with so much of happiness and promise, should
end, and the memory of it was the means of saddening their
whole after life.</p>

<p class='c007'>During one of their many excursions and picnics, Marion
Vance made the acquaintance of a young man, who was introduced
to her as Mr. George Sumner.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was about twenty-two years of age, not handsome, nor
even fine-looking, but possessed of a singular fascination of
manner that attracted her from the very first.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was introduced by a young man who was somewhat
attentive to Miss Kate Surrey, and who had met him at the
German University, where he was studying.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew nothing of him, beyond that he always had plenty
of money, and report said he was to fall heir to great possessions
upon the death of some aged relative.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been well received at the university, and it was
supposed that he belonged to a highly respectable family,
and he was consequently admitted into the best of society
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion Vance, with her fresh young heart, her susceptible
nature and impulse, was not long in learning to love
this fascinating stranger, which feeling Mr. Sumner appeared
to reciprocate, and, before half of her visit had expired,
he was secretly her declared lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gay Misses Surreys, intent upon their own beaux and
pleasures, were culpably heedless of the mischief that was
brewing in their midst, and of the toils which were being so
cunningly woven around their fair young visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were all older than Marion, and should have guarded
her against the constant attentions of any one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam Surrey, amid her many household cares, could not
always attend them upon their excursions, and whenever she
did accompany them she never dreamed that beneath the
quiet and polite attentions of Mr. Sumner to Marion there
lurked any deeper feeling than that of mere friendship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion, too, with wonderful tact, disguised her feelings,
for Mr. Sumner, and, for various unexplained reasons, had
insisted that their love for each other must for the present
be kept a profound secret; but, with the fire and impulse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>which made up her nature, she gave her whole heart up into
his keeping, and learned only when it was too late the heartlessness
and treachery of which her lover was capable and
she the victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Sumner, on his own part, had no other motive
in winning the affections of this beautiful and trusting girl
than his own selfish enjoyment of an idle summer’s day.</p>

<p class='c007'>His vacation must be spent somewhere, and he had drifted
in an aimless way to the neighborhood, having heard of its
beauties in the way of scenery and its advantages as a
summer resort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion was beautiful in looks, gay and attractive in manner,
and just such a girl as he liked to flirt with, but as for
ever marrying and acknowledging her as his wife, he had
not such a thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>He supposed her a simple country girl, defective in education
and knowledge of social customs—as, indeed, the poor
child was, having been left so long to the tender mercies
of a careless governess.</p>

<p class='c007'>He never dreamed that she was other than she pretended to
be—simply Marion Vance, with neither dowry nor position in
life. But <em>his</em> wife, when he married, must possess something
more substantial than a pretty face and winning manners—she
must have wealth and position in order to satisfy the
ambitious desires of the aspiring Mr. Sumner.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Marion, fondly believing that he loved her for herself
alone, drifted carelessly and happily along with the tide, and,
being of a somewhat romantic turn of mind, resolved to
enjoy till the very last this simple love-making, and, when
she had fully tested the strength and devotion of her valiant
knight, come out grandly and declare who she was, thus
surprising and rewarding him abundantly for his fidelity.
Silly child! Fatal trust!</p>

<p class='c007'>Like the cunning spider, he wove his net firmly about
her, and then left her to die by inches in its cruel toils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before six weeks of her visit had passed he had enticed
her into a secret marriage, sighing sweetly of “love in a
cottage” and the “devotion of a life-time;” and Marion too
blissfully happy to stop to look into the future, and enjoying
the novelty and romance of her position in being so tenderly
loved for her own bright self, never dreamed of the abyss
into which she was plunging with such headlong speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were married one still summer night, in a little chapel
in a neighboring town, by an aged minister, who (somewhat
to the surprise and annoyance of Mr. Sumner, who had
no idea of carrying the sacrilege so far) gave into the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>bride’s hands at the close of the ceremony a certificate of
that transaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when the time came for her return to her father,
Marion began to fear she had made a great mistake, and
grave questions began to suggest themselves for answering.</p>

<p class='c007'>How would the proud and aristocratic marquis receive the
knowledge of her marriage?</p>

<p class='c007'>How would he regard the son-in-law who would stoop to
win and marry his daughter in this underhanded and clandestine
manner?</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last week of her stay at Rye, Mr. Sumner
informed her that he had received an imperative summons
away on business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, George, I must go home next week, and then papa
must be told of our marriage. I supposed, of course, you
would go with me, and we could confess it together,” Marion
opposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Sumner frowned at this remark, then looked troubled
and perplexed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot go with you now; my summons is positive. You
will have to be patient and wait awhile until I can come to
you,” he answered, as indifferently as though he had not been
plotting the cruelest wrong in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I want the matter settled. I want papa to see you,
and I also wanted to tell you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped, resolving that she would not tell him of her
future prospects until they could confess their secret marriage
to her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It cannot be just yet,” he said, impatiently, and not heeding
her interrupted sentence. “My business must be attended
to, and our secret can wait a little longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are sure you love me only for my very self, George?”
she asked, nestling in his arms, and winding her own around
his neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What else should I love you for, little one?” he returned;
and well it was for her peace of mind that she could not
see the smile of scorn that curled his lips at her question.</p>

<p class='c007'>She laughed a merry, happy laugh, thinking how proud
she should be when he returned to her, and she should tell
him that she was the child of a marquis and heiress to almost
unlimited wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you do not regret what we have done?” she asked,
laying her golden head upon his breast, with a gesture
so full of confidence and love that a feeling of startled fear
stole over him for the moment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“What is there to regret, my little one? Have we not been
happy as the day is long?” he asked, evasively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are <em>sure</em> you do not regret, George?” she persisted;
and now the blue eyes were lifted anxiously to read his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I do not regret,” he said; and the sickening horror
with which she afterward remembered those words she never
forgot as long as she lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would write to her often until he could come to her,
he said, when she wept at parting, and agreed with her that
their marriage must be kept a secret until he could come
himself and tell her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>As his letters would arouse suspicion if sent directly to
Wycliffe in her name, and as he was not known at Richmond,
he would direct them to Mrs. George Sumner, and
she could get them herself at the office.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion went home to Wycliffe to wait for his coming, and
growing to fear more and more, as the days went by, that
she had done very wrong, and her father would be very
angry when he should discover it, but hoping that all would
come right when she should be able to introduce her husband,
and the marquis would be charmed as she had been
by his fascinating manners and his brilliant power of conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the weeks lengthened into months, and though his
letters came quite regularly, no George Sumner made his
appearance, or gave any hope that he should be able to do
so for a good while to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last his letters ceased coming, and then, indeed, the
poor child grew nearly wild with grief, fear, and anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>She became pale and thin, her eyes lusterless and heavy,
while she spent hours in her own rooms weeping and walking
the floor, her hands clasped convulsively on her breast,
her head drooping with its burden of anguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>She wrote and wrote again with the same result, and at
last, in despair, sent forth an appeal that ought to have
melted the stoutest heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>He <em>must</em> come to her, she said—it was not possible that
their marriage could be kept a secret any longer. They
must tell her father and share the consequences as best
they could.</p>

<p class='c007'>She waited a week, ten days, a fortnight, and no answer
came to her distressing appeal, and she wept and moaned
almost constantly, admitting no one to her presence, and
scarcely leaving her apartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time the marquis was called away from home
on business that would occupy him for a week.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Scarcely had he taken his departure when, with sudden
resolution, Marion informed her governess that she, also,
was going away for a few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mademoiselle Dufrond at once became very angry at this
intimation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marquis had recently expressed himself displeased that
his daughter was not attending more closely to her studies,
and desired that Mademoiselle Dufrond would be more
particular henceforth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mademoiselle must not go away,” she reiterated, “Monsieur,
her father, had explicitly said she must attend more
closely to her studies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Study! with that terrible burden pressing her down until
she was almost crushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The child felt that she should scream aloud at the thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot study; I am sick,” she said; and, unheeding the
angry remonstrance that followed, she left Wycliffe the day
following the marquis’ departure, and told no one whither
she was going.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII<br> <span class='large'>A WIFE’S APPEAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. George Sumner was agreeably entertaining a few of
his friends in his handsome lodgings in London one raw, dismal
night in January.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no suspicion of either cold or gloom in the
luxurious rooms where these boon companions were making
merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cheerful fire burned brightly in the polished grate; the
candelabra were filled with waxen tapers, which, shedding
their light over the closely drawn crimson curtains, cast a
rosy glow over the whole apartment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pictures hung upon the walls, some fine and beautiful,
while others were not of the most chaste character imaginable;
flowers bloomed and shed their fragrance from various
costly vases; busts of marble and figures in bronze were
scattered here and there, and the whole apartment bespoke
extravagance and luxurious living.</p>

<p class='c007'>A table was spread in the center of the room, glittering
with cut glass and silver, and heaped with a profusion of
viands, fruits, and wines of a quality to tempt the daintiest
epicurean taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four young men sat around this table, but for the moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>suspending their operations upon the good things set
before them, while they listened to a bacchanalian song from
one of their number.</p>

<p class='c007'>A knock at this moment interrupted the singer, and Mr.
Sumner, arising, went to answer the summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>A servant handed him a card and waited for orders, a
look of curious interest upon his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>A scowl of anger clouded George Sumner’s face as he
read the name which Marion had written with trembling
fingers upon its smooth surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>He passed out into the corridor, shutting the door after
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the lady?” he asked of the servant, in a low
tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the anteroom at the end of the passage,” he answered,
with a peculiar grin.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not considered just the thing for a young lady to
call, unattended, upon a gentleman at his lodgings, particularly
at so late an hour of the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well; tell her I will be there in a few minutes,”
George Sumner said, feeling exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The servant bowed and retired, while he returned to his
company.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as he could make it come right, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boys, I’m in a troublesome fix; I’ve just received a summons
upon important business, and shall be obliged to leave
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Sumner, it seems, was in the habit of receiving “summons
upon important business,” and there was now a noisy
protest against his leaving them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must,” he said, with some show of impatience; “but
you can stay and finish the feast; and, if I can possibly put
off the unpleasant affair, or get excused, I’ll return right
away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not staying to listen to their repeated regrets, George
Sumner hurried from the room and bent his steps to the
little reception-room at the end of the corridor.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he opened the door the first object that met his eyes
was a forlorn figure seated upon the sofa, her golden head
bowed in an attitude of weariness and misery upon its arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he expected, it was Marion.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the first sound of his footsteps upon the threshold she
started wildly up and threw herself, weeping, into his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, George, I am so miserable! Why did you not come
to me? Why did you not write to me?” she cried excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not come to you because I could not. I did not write
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>because I was too busy. You should have had patience,” he
said, coldly; and, releasing himself from her embrace, he
seated her again upon the sofa, and then stood waiting before
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>His coolness, almost amounting to disgust, calmed her more
effectually than any words could have done.</p>

<p class='c007'>She caught her breath back in a sob of pain, and regarded
him with wondering eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I had ‘patience,’ how soon would you have come
to me?” she asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” he answered, moodily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>You don’t know!</em> after what I wrote you!” she cried, in
breathless astonishment, and with quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Marion,” he said, after a moment’s thought, and with
sudden resolution, “<em>I could not have come at all!</em>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>You—could—not—have—come—at—all!</em>” she repeated,
every bit of color forsaking her face at the dreadful words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was what I said,” he replied, sullenly, and feeling
as he had never in his life felt before, with those eyes,
so full of horrible anguish, fixed upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“George, <em>what</em> do you mean? Surely <em>not</em> what you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hollow tones in which these words were uttered were
fearfully calm now, and the little hands which he had so
often held and kissed were clenched until the nails were
purple.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Marion,” he said, firmly, and with a cold, merciless
glitter in his eyes—he might as well finish this business first
as last—“I do mean just what I have said, and it was very
imprudent in you to come here to-night; it will subject me to
very unpleasant and annoying remarks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not understand you,” the white lips uttered, in the
same tone as before, though Marion’s blue eyes glittered as
he had never seen them, and her small head was lifted in
sudden though bitter pride. “I cannot understand how the
coming of your <em>wife</em> can subject you to ‘unpleasant and annoying
remarks,’” she added, when he did not reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you not, when it is not known that I have a wife?”
he asked, a little smile that she could not interpret curving
his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>His coldness and indifference were nearly killing her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“True! I have forgotten; I am bewildered; I am nearly
<em>crazed</em> with my misery. But, George, that fact can be no
longer concealed; you must return with me to Richmond
and confess our marriage to papa. I must be owned as a
lawful wife before another day passes,” she said, wearily,
yet with decision.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Impossible, Marion!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why impossible?” she demanded, with flashing eyes.
“Do you understand that the secret <em>cannot</em> be kept any
longer—that it must be confessed at once?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nevertheless it <em>is</em> impossible! I—I regret that there
should be anything unpleasant about the matter; but I cannot
go with you to Mr. Vance and tell him that you are my
wife, simply because, Marion, <em>you are not my wife</em>!” he
concluded, with a sigh of relief that the truth was at last
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>George!</em> why <em>will</em> you jest thus when I am so miserable?”
shrieked the unhappy girl, throwing up her arms with
a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could not believe that he spoke the truth, and yet
there was something horribly real about it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Sumner looked uneasily around at that outburst.
It would not do to have the whole house know that a young
and beautiful girl had sought him there at that time of night.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went to her side and seized her firmly by the wrists.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be still, Marion,” he said, angrily, “and listen to me,
and do not make another sound while you are here, unless
you intend to ruin us both.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked at him with hollow, bewildered eyes, too miserable
and stunned by his words and manner to hardly comprehend
what he was saying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I went down to Rye last summer,” he resumed,
coldly, and with a determined air, “I went merely to have a
jolly good time. I found a lot of pretty girls there, and I
joined their set and met you, and had not then the slightest
intention of doing you any wrong. You were young, gay,
and pretty, and I made love to you, as I have done to a dozen
others before. On the impulse of the moment I proposed a
secret marriage, not having the least idea that you would
consent to it; but you did, and I found myself in a fix. I
<em>could</em> not marry you in good faith, for the girl whom I
marry must have plenty of money and an established position
in the world; you had neither, and I had to get out of the
scrape I was in as best I could.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion Vance here opened her lips with sudden eagerness,
as if to speak, then as suddenly closed them again, and
a strange look of fire and scorn mingled with the bitterness
and pain in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” he went on, not noticing it, too intent upon getting
the scene over with as soon as possible, “when you accepted
my proposal I had to do <em>something</em>; so I got a friend
of mine to disguise himself to look like the old rector of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>St. John’s chapel, and, by bribing the sexton, he allowed us
to go into the church for the ceremony to be performed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And <em>that</em> was the way you married me—<em>me!</em>” she whispered,
in suppressed tones, never once having taken her eyes
from his during the horrible recital.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not help it, Marion—you gave yourself away to
me so readily, you adopted so eagerly my proposals,” he
said, excusing himself by blaming her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her lips curled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you nothing better than that to say for yourself?
Have you no reparation to offer me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he answered, coldly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“None!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“George,” she cried, in agony, “think how I have loved
you, how I have trusted you! Can you let me suffer thus
and show me no pity?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My pity could do you no practical good now,” he answered,
carelessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you <em>will not</em> right the wrong—you will not cover
my shame?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot,” he still repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“George Sumner, you do not know the bitter, cruel wrong
that you are doing. Ah, Heaven! why was I so blind,
so mad that I did not see and realize it myself? You do
not once dream of the misery you are entailing upon future
generations,” she cried, with clasped hands upraised in agony,
as she remembered her father in his pride, and the will
of the previous marquis, and knew that unless she became a
lawful wife the entail would be cut off from that branch
of their family, her father’s hopes forever destroyed, and
herself irretrievably disgraced; and yet with a strange perversity
she would not tell the man who had betrayed her
of her position, when she knew it was that alone he desired,
and not herself or her love.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would rather die than marry him and lift him to the
position he craved, and know all the time that she was an
unloved wife, a despised stepping-stone to his ambition.</p>

<p class='c007'>If he would but show the least sign of relenting, or of
his by-gone affection for her, she would have told him joyfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he did not, he had none to show, and his next words
extinguished every hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Marion, there is no use in prolonging this interview;
what you wish cannot be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Reader, did you ever see any one grow instantly old—the
light, and life, and joy fade forever out of a face that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>had been fresh and lovely in one moment of time; and lines
of age, misery, and care settle where there had been nothing
but beauty before? If so, you may know something of how
Marion Vance looked as she listened to what George Sumner
told her on that dismal night in January, as she sat in
that little reception-room at the end of the passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can I believe you?” she said. “Can I believe any one
would ruin a young and trusting girl like that? You mean
to tell me that it was only a mock marriage—that ceremony
and certificate that the pretended old man gave me only a
sham?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was all,” George Sumner confessed, feeling strangely
uneasy with those unearthly eyes fixed so steadily upon
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was <em>all</em>!” she repeated, with bitter emphasis. “I
have but one more question to ask you,” she continued, still
unnaturally calm, but looking like a dead person, all but
her burning, restless eyes. “Once for all, will you marry
me <em>now</em>, legally and honorably?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because, as I told you, it is absolutely necessary that the
woman I marry should have plenty of money and an established
position in the world,” he said, flushing beneath her
look.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion smiled that strange smile again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, if I could bring you plenty of money, and assure
of my undisputed right to a good position in society, you
would perhaps do me the honor to make me your wife?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—I suppose I might,” he replied, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you will <em>not</em> do that act of justice to save the
woman you have professed to love ‘better than your own
life’ from the shame and disgrace that must surely come
upon her without?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot; I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>What</em> hinders you?” she interrupted, with an imperative
gesture.</p>

<p class='c007'>His face assumed a dogged expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The determination to be <em>rich</em> and move in the highest
circles,” he said, his tone assuming something of defiance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you are not <em>rich</em> now—you do not rightly belong
to the high sphere that is accredited to you—you are only
a poor, miserable fortune-hunter after all—a sham and impostor!”
she cried, with biting sarcasm and indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>He flushed even more hotly than before; his gaze wavered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and fell beneath the scorn in her eye, and he stood revealed
in his real character before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You cannot, therefore, be hampered with a poor wife;
she would be a miserable clog upon your laudable ambition.
Love, pure and holy though it might be, weighs as nothing
compared with the treasures you seek,” she went on, until,
goaded to desperation by her scorn, he turned upon her with
a snarl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have learned the truth at last—what more do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to know, George Sumner—and I charge you
speak the truth—did you <em>ever</em> love me as <em>I</em> understand the
word? Is there anything of that feeling still in your heart
for me? Is there a particle of feeling in your heart that
would prompt you to sacrifice a single interest to save me
from my impending ruin? Do not dare to speak falsely—tell
me, have you any love for me?” she concluded, with a
solemnity that made his flesh creep, bold and bad as he
was.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his eyes fixed upon the carpet, as though they had
been weighted and held there, he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I do not love you, Marion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there one in all the world whom you do love thus?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not one,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not even among the ‘dozen’ with whom you have
flirted?” she said, with a hard laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>He cringed uneasily. He was showing himself up in a
way that was not at all agreeable to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enough!” she cried, sternly, without waiting for him to
reply; and she arose and stood before him, confronting
him like an avenging angel. “George Sumner, you are a
heartless wretch, selfish to the core, and bent upon your
own sensual enjoyment alone. You stand there and seek
to cast the blame of my misery all upon me. You say ‘you’
could not help it. I ‘gave myself away to you so readily,’
and ‘adopted your proposals too eagerly.’ Who was it that
begged and pleaded for my love, who could not live without
me, who would be willing to share a crust, so that he might
but be blessed with my presence? Who was it that swore
life-long devotion to me, and tempted me with blissful pictures
of ‘love in a cottage,’ and whose heart would break
if separated from me for but a day? It does not sound so
well repeated under existing circumstances, does it, my aspiring
knight?” she continued, even more bitterly: “the heart
of the sentiment is gone, and it becomes but an empty, mocking
sound. But do you realize how young I was, George
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Sumner?” she said, speaking sternly now—“<em>sixteen!</em> with no
mother to guide me, no dear, wise friend in whom to confide,
or of whom to seek counsel. You were twenty-two, and had
flirted with a dozen before me. Did you ruin them all, traitor,
coward that you are? Did you lure them all into secret
marriages, and then cast them off in their misery, as you are
to-night casting me? Or were they wiser than I—not so
eager to give themselves away, or to adopt your proposals?</p>

<p class='c007'>“You need not speak,” she cried, bitterly, as he opened
his lips as if to defend himself. “I never wish to hear
your voice again, and if I could paralyze your tongue so
that you could never cheat a trusting woman again, I would
do it; but it is not for me to avenge—your punishment
is coming; it is nearer even than you dream. You are ambitious,
but that very ambition has overreached itself, as you
will find before you are a great deal older. You are a cheat,
a liar, and a coward; and now let me tell you that I would
not marry <em>you if my doing so would save both your life and
mine</em>. I will bear my shame alone, and some day your eyes
will be opened, and you will curse yourself with bitterest
curses that you have dared to do the thing that you have
done. I was a young and inexperienced girl; you won my
fresh, pure love, and ruined me, to pass away a dull hour
and have a ‘jolly good time.’ A day, an hour will come when
you will turn sick with remorse, and be willing to give the
best years of your life to undo the foul wrong which you
have so heartlessly wrought; but you will never see Marion
Vance, the girl with neither ‘name,’ nor ‘wealth,’ nor ‘position,’
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned and walked, with a quick, firm tread, from
the room, before he could recover his almost stupefied senses.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had never dreamed that the simple, trusting, loving
girl, whom he had hitherto been able to mold to his lightest
wish, possessed so much spirit and reserve power, and
her burning, blighting words had fallen upon him like flashes
of lightning, blinding and bewildering him with their vividness.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she was gone—that farce was played out to the end,
and though the end had been anything but agreeable, yet
it was over at last; and, smoothing his ruffled brow and
calling a smile to his false lips, he went back to his boon
companions, and tried to drown the heart-broken words of
a ruined girl in copious draughts of sparkling champagne.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII<br> <span class='large'>A STARTLING DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Marion Vance, after leaving the man whom, during that
one hour’s interview, she had learned to loathe and despise
as intensely as before she had loved him, returned directly
to Wycliffe, where in the silence of her own room, she
waited in dumb despair for the return of the marquis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a stern, set face, she sought everything—how
she had refused while away on her visit to be introduced
as his daughter, and thus brought upon herself this misery—and
that when she found that the one upon whom she
had lavished her affection cared only for position and wealth,
she had kept silence, resolving rather to suffer her shame
than to gratify his ambition when he proved to be so heartless
and base. The only thing she reserved was the name of
the man for whom she had sacrificed her birthright; and no
amount of persuasions or threats could compel her to reveal
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marquis sat stern and rigid while listening to this
confession from his only child.</p>

<p class='c007'>He uttered no reproaches, he gave way to no violent
passion or grief, only when she had concluded, he pointed
with shaking finger to the door, saying, with perfectly hueless
lips:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know, Marion Vance, what you have done? You
have cut off the inheritance forever from my heirs—you
have sold your birthright for a mess of pottage, and it will
go to Arthur Tressalia’s son, your cousin Paul. Do you
hear? You have ruined both yourself and me. You have
made me worse than childless. Go, and never let me look
upon your face again while you live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, do not—oh! do not send me away alone—alone
into the cold, cruel world. I am your only child. I have
no one but you. I love you, papa. Oh, have mercy! Let
me stay here in my home. I will be very quiet and humble.
I will never trouble you, only let me be where I can see
and hear you sometimes,” Marion cried, in her despair, as she
cast herself upon her knees before the stern man.</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned away from her with a face of stone, yet with
a heart bursting with disappointment and agony equal to
her own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go, I say. You shall not suffer; you shall have three
hundred pounds a year, and more if that is not enough; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>never let me see you again. I could not bear it and live,”
was all he said in reply to her agonized entreaties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion tottered from the room, praying that the earth
would open and swallow her and her misery, and bury her
in oblivion.</p>

<p class='c007'>That day she left Wycliffe forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>She fled to a small town in the southwest of England,
assumed a name, and lived there in quiet seclusion until
her son was seventeen years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart was broken, her life was ruined, but she never
told her boy the story of her shame and the disgrace she
had entailed upon him until she lay upon her dying bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had got the idea, and always believed, that his father
had died before he was born, and seeing that it pained his
mother to talk of the past, he never mentioned it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion determined, since she had been the means of
robbing him of his proud title and position, that she would
devote her life to him, and rear him with a character stamped
with grandeur with which no worldly title could ever endow
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She taught him to hate everything mean or low—to love
and cling to the truth, no matter what opposed—to be a
<em>manly man</em>, never despising or exalting any one on account
of position alone; but to admire and emulate true worth
wherever he might find it, and regard every one whom he
could respect as an equal.</p>

<p class='c007'>She gave him the very best education that her means
would allow; and, being naturally bright and talented, he
was at seventeen far in advance of other youths of his age.
Marion’s health now began to fail, and it soon became evident
to her that all that remained to her of life would be
a very brief span.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she grew weaker day by day, she became greatly depressed
in her mind regarding the past and its connection
with her son’s future, and at last she called him to her and
told him all the sad story of her life; and all his outraged
manhood, all his deep and tender love for her, arose in arms
as he listened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother!” he cried, his head thrown back, his eyes flashing
fire, his nostrils dilating, his lips quivering with indignation,
shame, and wounded pride, “I will find the man—no, I cannot
call him a <em>man</em>—the brute who dared to do so vile a thing,
and I will brand him the traitor and the coward that he is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My son, never forget that vengeance belongs to a mightier
arm than your own—never forget that <em>you</em> belong to a noble
race; and even though you may never claim your kindred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>let your life testify to the respect you bear for the blood
which flowed in your mother’s veins,” was all the reply which
Marion vouchsafed to his boyish outburst of anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! my dear, gentle little mother,” he said, kissing
her wasted hands, “you always teach me to do right; but
I bear my kindred no love; they have cruelly wronged you.
I think I cannot even respect that man whom you say is
my grandfather, even though he be the Marquis of Wycliffe.
How could he have driven you forth from your home in such
bitterness?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not realize the cruel disappointment it was to
him to have his hopes thus ruined. If I had not been so
blind and foolish in my love, <em>you</em> would now be the heir
of all his proud possessions. I have wronged you also, my
noble boy,” she sighed, in bitter pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not think of it, dear mother. It was not your fault;
you were cheated and ruined by a designing villain. Oh, that
I may meet him some day!” he cried, all the blood of his
noble ancestors running riot in his veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was very handsome, and his mother told him that he
looked like his grandfather, the Marquis of Wycliffe, which
to him, in his bitterness against his treatment of her, sounded
like very tame praise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” he burst out one day afterward, “have you
one particle of affection remaining for—that man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my dear. That was crushed; all my wild love was
burned to ashes that night when, in my misery, he turned
from me, and I went out alone to battle with my shame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is well. But, mother, please do not call it <em>shame</em>.
<em>You</em> were guiltless of any wrong. The <em>shame</em>, if there be
any, is his,” he urged, with troubled brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion sighed and let the matter drop. If the shame was
not to be imputed to her, she had suffered as though it
were.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that day her son was changed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new dignity of purpose seemed to crown him. His boyishness
dropped from him all at once, and he suddenly developed,
mentally, into the full stature of a man. He became
grave and thoughtful, but a new and deeper tenderness pervaded
all his care of his mother thereafter, making him gentle
as a woman in his sympathy and attention to her wants.</p>

<p class='c007'>She died blessing him, and telling him what a comfort
he had been to her all his life, and bidding him not forget
the lessons she had taught him of truth and right.</p>

<p class='c007'>With an almost breaking heart, he buried her under a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>noble, sweeping elm, in a quiet spot of the village cemetery,
and felt as if he had not a friend upon the face of the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sent a notice of her death to the Marquis of Wycliffe,
declining all further aid from him upon his own behalf, and
then went forth into the world to battle for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing he resolved to do before settling down to the
real business of life, and that was to visit the place where
his mother had been made the victim of such baseness and
treachery.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went down to South Sussex County, visited Rye, and
all the places she had described to him, and thought of her
there, as a fair and innocent girl, filled to the brim with joy
and gayety.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw the house, the Surrey mansion, where she had
spent those eight short, happy weeks and longed to enter,
that he might see the rooms where her gay laughter had
rang out and her light and nimble feet had danced to tuneful
measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he did not even enter the grounds, passing them with
a heavy sigh for the happiness that had been sacrificed there;
and then he took his way to the little village where St. John’s
chapel stood, and where that sacrilegious fraud had been perpetrated.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there he made a startling discovery!</p>

<p class='c007'>It was nearly sunset when he reached the chapel, and
as he lifted his hat on entering the sacred place, still thinking
of his mother, who believed herself a happy bride when
her feet had crossed its threshold, the last notes of a sweet
hymn died away on the organ within.</p>

<p class='c007'>He crossed the vestibule, and was about opening the inner
door, when a lady came down from the organ loft and met
him face to face.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was about twenty-five or six years of age, with a very
sweet and lovely though sad face, and she bowed kindly and
graciously to the stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>He returned the salutation, and then asked if she would
tell him where he could find the sexton.</p>

<p class='c007'>She pointed out to him a little cottage near by, and as
he started to go toward it, she turned and walked with him,
remarking the beauty of the day and the glorious sunset,
which they could see through the overarching trees that
grew about the chapel.</p>

<p class='c007'>More than once he found himself searching her sweet face,
and there was something in her manner and in the tones
of her voice which made him wonder it at some time in her
life she, too, had not suffered deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Perhaps,” he thought, “there is another tale of wrong,
and misery, and disappointment connected with <em>her</em> life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They walked together as far as the sexton’s house, she
passing in to speak to the wife, while he sought the man
who was working in the garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>He questioned him regarding the incidents already related,
about the secret marriage that had occurred nearly
eighteen years previous; and when the young man told him
who he was—the son of that fair young bride—he was surprised
to see him betray deep emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, mister,” he said, eyeing him keenly, “I remember
clearly the young gentleman and pretty lady that came here
to be married, and he, the groom, paid me a handsome sum
to leave the chapel unlocked, so that they could go there
for the ceremony. He would bring his own clergyman, he
said, and as the marriage would have to be kept secret for
awhile, he wanted it done as late as possible, and no lights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sexton here stopped and leaned reflectively upon the
handle of his spade, while he contemplated the neat little
chapel visible through the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you, sir,” he at length resumed, “the sight of the
gentleman’s money won me at first, but when I came to think
it all over, I seemed to think that somehow it did not have
a right look—their not wanting any lights and coming so late
in the evening, to say nothing about their bribing me to let
them into the chapel. I thought if it was honest and square,
even if the marriage was to be a secret, they might have
come quietly but openly, and at a proper time, for the ceremony;
and, sir—I beg your pardon if I did wrong, but my
conscience was heavy—the gold seemed like the price of innocent
blood to me, and I went and confessed the whole
thing to the old rector himself, and gave him the money to
put in the poor-box.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion’s son started violently at these last words, and he
grew white and trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>When</em> did you make this confession—<em>before</em> or <em>after</em> marriage?”
he asked, with intense eagerness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The afternoon before, sir. I felt that if there was anything
wrong about the affair, the good old rector would see
that it was made right. He reprimanded me severely for
the betrayal of my trust, as he called it, but he relieved my
mind by saying that no wrong should be done. Sir, you are
faint,” he said, noticing his visitor’s ghastly face, which was
absolutely startling in its pallor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; go on! go on!” he breathed, in a voice that sounded
strange even to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Well, sir, you had better sit down upon the bench, for
you don’t look able to stand;” and he indicated a rustic bench
near by, and the young man sank weakly upon it, motioning
his companion to proceed. “I don’t know, sir, how the
old rector managed that business, but I <em>do</em> know that after
that young couple had entered the chapel I crept softly up
and looked in through an open window, and—<em>I heard his
reverence marry them good and strong as ever a couple was
married in the world</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you <em>sure</em>?” demanded his listener, actually gasping
for breath at this startling and unexpected announcement,
while he wiped away the great drops of sweat that had gathered
upon his brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As sure, sir, as that I am talking to you at this moment,”
returned the old man, confidently. “I could not <em>see</em> the
rector, it is true, for the chapel was dark, but I knew the
good old man’s voice well, and I <em>know</em> that, instead of the
young man’s clergyman—if a clergyman he had with him at
all—marrying them, the rector of St. John’s chapel said the
ceremony over them himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if you could prove this to me!” Marion’s son said,
an agony of longing in his concentrated tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sexton shook his head with an air of perplexity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot prove it, sir, except by my word, and I’ve never
told any one before; but you, sir, being the son of the pretty
young lady—I had seen her before, strolling with the gentleman—you
being her child, have a right to know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rector! the rector! where is he? If this is true, he
can prove it,” his companion cried, starting up with excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, sir, he has been dead these ten years, and there is
a young man in his place who could not know anything about
this,” the sexton replied, with a look of pity at the handsome
young stranger who was so painfully agitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And there were no other witnesses—you were the only
one who saw and heard this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, I was the only one as far as I know; but,”
with sudden thought, “I’ve heard that the old rector never
went to bed at night without first writing down everything
that had happened during the day, and perhaps Miss Isabel—that’s
the rector’s daughter, sir, as came with you hither,
bless her kind heart!—perhaps she could tell you something
more about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. What you have told me to-night is of the
most vital importance, as you have doubtless judged by my
unavoidable excitement. If what you say can be proved, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>will repair one of the greatest wrongs ever committed upon
this earth,” Marion’s son replied, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feared it—I feared it at the time—may God forgive
me for ever betraying my trust,” murmured the old man,
brokenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you atoned for it—you were tempted as all are
liable to be tempted, and I hope and trust that your repentance
may have been the means of saving a proud name
from dishonor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Isabel can tell you if any one can,” answered the
sexton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will wait, then, until she comes from the cottage, and
seek an interview with her,” returned the youth; and, though
his stock of money was none too large, he generously dropped
a golden guinea into the old man’s hand, and then, too deeply
moved to remain quiet, he paced back and forth beneath
the trees, while waiting for the rector’s daughter to appear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='large'>THE RECTOR’S DIARY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The sweet-faced Miss Isabel did not try his patience long.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been deeply interested in the young and handsome
stranger, wondering who he was, and whence he came,
as well as why he should seek their quiet little chapel, and
then the old sexton.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had heard his last words to the old man, and knew
that he was desirous of speaking with her. She at once
arose, and, as soon as she came forth from the cottage, he
immediately approached her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon,” he said, courteously, lifting his hat, “but may
I crave a little conversation with you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly,” she answered, with a sweet graciousness that
made him think of his mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then stated something of his object in coming there,
and also the startling revelation of the sexton, as well as
what he had said regarding the rector’s diary, and begged
her, if it was in her power, to let him know the truth of
the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face grew sad and full of pity as she listened to him,
and realized something of the wrong that had been suffered
for so many years, and when he had finished she said simply:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I can give you comfort. Come with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>How his heart bounded at the words “I can give you
comfort;” and, heaving a breath that was almost a sob, a
cry of thankfulness went up to God from his heart for the
light that was beginning to shine upon his darkened life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Isabel Grafton, for that was the lady’s name, led the
way toward a small villa, built in the Gothic style, near by.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a charming little place, covered with vines and
climbing roses, and surrounded by noble trees with here and
there a patch of gay flowers adding brightness to the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>She invited him to enter, and ushered him into a cool and
shady parlor, when she excused herself for a few moments.
She was not gone long, and when she returned she carried
two or three large books in her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These books,” she explained, laying them carefully upon
the table, as if they were a precious treasure, “comprise
my father’s diary, and, I think, never during his life did he
omit the record of a single day. I have taken a sad pleasure,”
she continued, with a starting tear, “in reading them since
his death, and I also think that there is considerable here regarding
the events of which you speak. Now, if you will
please give me the date I will see if I can find it for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He told her, and then sat in painful suspense while she
turned those pages penned by a hand long since palsied in
death, and which might contain so much of hope for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she said at last, “here is one entry—the first, I
think, since it corresponds with the date you gave me;” and
she passed him the book to let him read for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>His emotion was so great that at first the words seemed
blurred and indistinct, and it was a minute or two before
his vision became clear enough to read.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he read this:</p>

<p class='c007'>“August 11th, 18—. A strange thing occurred to-day.
Thomas Wight, the sexton of St. John’s chapel, came to
me in evident distress, and confessed a conspiracy in which
he was concerned, or rather a wrong into which he had
been tempted by the offer of gold, and which lay exceeding
heavy on his heart. A young man had hired him to
leave the chapel open after dark that evening, that he might
come to be married secretly to a young and beautiful girl,
and he told him, moreover, that he would bring his own
clergyman with him to perform the ceremony. He paid the
sexton a golden eagle to do him the service, which the poor
fellow, conscience-smitten like Judas of old, came and delivered
up to me for the poor. I resolved at once to investigate
the affair, for it appeared to me as if a wrong of some kind
was being perpetrated, wherein a young, trusting and perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>motherless girl, like my own fair Isabel, was being deceived.
The result proved even as I thought—a romance
begun, a wrong beheaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An hour before the time that Thomas Wight told me was
set apart for the strange couple to come to the chapel, I
repaired thither and concealed myself behind the drapery of
a curtain in the robing-room. It was nearly dark, but not so
dark but that I could distinguish objects quite distinctly, and
I had not been there long before a young man, of perhaps
thirty years, quietly entered, and immediately proceeded to
disguise himself with a white wig and a full, flowing white
beard. I knew then, beyond a doubt, that a great wrong was
contemplated, for the hair and beard was an exact counterpart
of my own. He then approached my private closet,
took down the robe and surplice, and was about to put them
on, when I stepped forth from my hiding-place and addressed
him thus:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Friend, what art thou about to do with these emblems
of a sacred office? Those are holy vestures which none but
a priest unto God has a right to wear.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The robe dropped from his nerveless hand upon the floor,
and he turned a white, startled face to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Who are you?’ he at length demanded, with an effort
to recover himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am Bishop Grafton, and rector of St. John’s parish.
Who are you?’ I asked mildly, in return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It does not matter who I am,’ he muttered, angrily, and
standing before me with an exceedingly crest-fallen air; and
I proceeded with solemn gravity:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Friend, I learned this afternoon that a great wrong
was to be committed here this evening, and I came here to
stop it, if possible.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I spoke the words at a venture—and not so, either, for
the man’s manner had convinced me of the fact already—and
my words took immediate effect, for, with a muttered
imprecation, he tore the wig and beard from his head and
face and threw them also upon the floor beside the robe and
surplice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Friend,’ I then demanded, sternly, ‘are you a minister of
Jesus Christ?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No,’ he muttered, with a vile oath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then you were about to personate a bishop of the church
and commit sacrilege. I will relieve you from both the
mockery and the sin. I will myself perform this marriage
ceremony.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But——’ he began, in an excited manner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“‘You will please give me the names of the parties about
to be united, and the <em>correct ones</em>,’ I interrupted, peremptorily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He gave them, and, lighting a taper, I inserted them in
the blanks of the certificate with which I had provided myself
before leaving home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Now you can go,’ I added, and pointed to the rear door,
which led into the church-yard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He hesitated, and began to stammer something about
some one being very angry at the turn affairs were taking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Enough!’ I cried, sternly. ‘Do not dare to interfere with
me; you can quietly retire and leave things to take their
course; or, since I now recognize you as one of the strangers
visiting Rye for the summer, I will cause you to be arrested
on the morrow for sacrilege, and having tampered with
things belonging to the house of God. Hark!’ I added, as we
heard steps entering the chapel; ‘they have come; choose
quickly and go; or, if you fear to do that, acknowledge, in
the presence of yonder couple, the fraud you were about to
commit. I will not have so foul a wrong perpetrated; if
a young and trusting maiden believes she is about to become
a lawful wife, a wife she <em>shall</em> be; I will not allow her to be
deceived.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“A moment longer he hesitated, as if undecided which
course to pursue, then, with a terrible imprecation upon me
and the whole proceeding, he turned away and glided forth
into the darkness, and I saw him no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was but the work of an instant for me to don the
robe and surplice which he had dropped in his fright, and
I was at the altar in time to receive the strange couple, one
of whom I was now convinced was a designing villain, the
other his victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The maiden was apparently very young, and my heart
was pained for her; her voice was sweet and childish as
she made the responses, and I felt in my soul that she must
be motherless, or she would not be there in any such way
as that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The propriety of my adopting the course I did might
be questioned by some, and the thought arise why I did not
instead denounce the villain and save the child. I had reasoned
all that within myself, and was convinced that if she
was so infatuated with her lover that he had won her consent
to a secret marriage, it would not be difficult for him
to win her again to his will, and, even in the face of my
revelation, to do her the foul wrong he had planned. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>judged that the greatest kindness I could do her would be to
make her really a wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In less than ten minutes the vows which made them one
were pronounced, and they were as truly man and wife as any
who ever took upon themselves the vows of matrimony;
and, putting the certificate of the transaction in the young
bride’s hand, I saw them go forth into their new life, feeling
that whatever happened, I had done what I could.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not believe that with that certificate in her possession,
whereon my name was written in my boldest hand,
to prove the transaction, that any very great harm could
come to that child-wife. I returned to the robing-room, removed
my vestures, picked up the wig and beard which still
lay there, and brought them home with me as trophies of a
strange adventure. They are locked within the third drawer
of the old Grafton bureau. God bless and spare that innocent
maiden; my heart yearneth over her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus ended the bishop’s first entry regarding that strange
adventure, and a long, deep sigh, as if some heavy burden
had rolled from his heart, burst from Marion Vance’s son
as he finished reading it and laid down the book.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank God!” he said, devoutly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Amen!” murmured the sweet-faced Miss Isabel, who had
sat silently watching him as he read, and who seemed to
comprehend and sympathize with all that that burst of thanks
meant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is something more, I believe, a little farther on,”
she said, after a moment of silence, and reaching for the
book. “Here it is,” she added, after turning several pages.
“I have read it a great many times, and <em>hoped</em> that that
young girl might have been happy; and yet I feared for her—there
is <em>so much</em> that is sad in the world,” she concluded,
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>The excited youth again seized the book eagerly, and read:</p>

<p class='c007'>“September 10th, 18—. My heart has been unaccountably
heavy to-day for that young maiden whom I so strangely
wedded about a month ago. Perhaps the event was recalled
by my meeting the villain who was to perform the mock
ceremony. He avoided me with a blush of shame, turning
short in his tracks as he saw me approaching. It is well that
he can feel even shame for his sin. But something impressed
me that that young wife might some time need even stronger
evidence than the certificate I gave her—it might be lost,
destroyed, or <em>stolen</em>, and then there would be nothing to
prove her position if I should die; and so, I resolved to make
a record here of their names, and the date of their marriage:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“<span class='sc'>Married</span>—In St. John’s Chapel, Winchelsea, August 11th,
18—, by the Reverend Joshua Grafton, bishop, and rector of
St. John’s parish, George Sumner, of Rye, to Miss Marion
Vance, also of Rye. I take my oath that this is a true statement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“September 10th, 18—.      <span class='sc'>Joshua Grafton</span>, Rector.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was all; but was it not enough?</p>

<p class='c007'>The book dropped from the youth’s nerveless hand, and
his involuntary cry smote heavily the heart of the gentle
woman sitting so silently in the gathering twilight near
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mother—mother!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was as though he could not bear it, and she not there
to share it with him—this tardy justice, this blessed revelation.
His heart was filled almost to bursting with grief that
she should have suffered all those long years, bearing so
patiently her burden of shame, when she might even now
be living, honored and respected.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was only thirty-four when she died—just the time
when life should have been at its prime.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was beautiful, and so constituted that she could have
enjoyed to their fullest extent all the good things that belonged
to her high position in life; and it seemed too cruel,
when they might all have been hers—when they <em>were</em> hers
by right—that she should have been so crushed, and her
life so corroded and early destroyed by this foul wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Marion Vance had learned submission and humility
from her life of trial—she had learned to <em>trust</em> where the
way was so dark that she could not <em>see</em>, and she had told
her son on her death-bed that notwithstanding she could not
fathom the wisdom of the lesson of sorrow that she had had
to learn, yet she did not doubt that it would all result for
good in the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may perhaps be a nobler man,” she had said, with
her hand resting fondly on his chestnut curls, “for having
been reared in obscurity, instead of an heir to great possessions;
you will, at all events, realize that a noble character
is more to be desired than a mere noble-sounding name,
and if you should ever rise to eminence by your own efforts,
you will not forget the teachings of your mother, and they
will help to keep you in the path of rectitude and honor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He remembered those last words now, and though he was
always comforted when he thought of them, yet he could not
keep down the wish that she might have lived, and he been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>permitted to see her face light up with hope and joy that
there was no stain resting upon her or him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But doubtless she knew it all in Heaven now, and was rejoicing
on his account.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was no longer a nameless outcast from society; he
could now hold his head aloft with the proudest in the land—he
had no cause for shame, save the knowledge that his
father had been one of the vilest villains who walked the
face of the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where was he now?” he wondered, a hot flush of anger
mounting his brow, as it always did when he thought of
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was he living or dead?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Dead</em>, he hoped, but that was a thing he had yet to find
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>He wondered how the Marquis of Wycliffe would receive
the knowledge that he had gained to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could now seek him and claim his inheritance if he
chose—there was no reason why he should not do so, except
that his heart shrank with indignation and bitterness from
the stern man who, with a face of flint, had sent his mother,
a tender, suffering woman, so cruelly into the world to
wrestle with life’s stern realities, with neither sympathy
nor love to smooth its rough way.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew that he should claim his inheritance some time;
it belonged to him as Marion’s legitimate son, and according
to the conditions of the old marquis’ will.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would go and rule Wycliffe some day, and show the
world how Marion Vance, the despised and scorned, had
reared her son. Oh, if she could but have lived to be proud
of him and enjoy the good that was coming to him! This
was ever the burden of his thought, but it could not be,
and he could only strive to remember and follow her pure
teachings, and win for himself the respect that had been
denied her.</p>

<p class='c007'>But first he had a work to do. He could not go to Wycliffe
yet, much as he desired to re-establish his mother’s
reputation. He must first find the man who had sought her
ruin, to “pass away a summer holiday and to have a jolly
good time.” If he were dead he would find his grave and
be satisfied. If he was living, he would search until he found
him, brand him with his traitorous designs, and prove to him
that in his wickedness he had overreached himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, and not until then, could he present himself before
the Marquis of Wycliffe, and demand to be acknowledged
as his heir.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>He did not realize how long he had been sitting there
musing over these things until a slight movement of Miss
Grafton’s aroused him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, and pardon me for my absent-mindedness,”
he said, starting. “I shall not soon forget your kindness;
and may I trespass upon it still further? Will you allow me
to make a copy of what I have read?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, if it will be of any benefit to you,” Miss Grafton
answered, the look of kindly sympathy still on her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He noticed it, and, after a moment’s thoughtful hesitation,
said, with a rising flush:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This young bride of whom the rector has written was
my mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Was?</em>” she repeated in a sad tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, was,” he said, with a trembling lip. “She died only
a week ago, and I feel that it is due to you, for your kindness
to me, that I should tell you this. She believed, and
has believed all these long years, that she was most cruelly
wronged. She was driven from her beautiful home on account
of it, and has suffered in silence ever since. I knew
nothing of her sad history, believing my father had died
before my birth, until a very short time before her own
death. It was true that she had the certificate of which the
rector speaks, but that man told her, and she believed, it
was a sham and a forgery. Whether he was ever told or discovered
that his accomplice was foiled and driven from
the field, and a <i><span lang="la">bona fide</span></i> marriage performed, is a mystery;
but I am rather inclined to think he did not, since, if he
ever discovered my mother’s position in life, he would undoubtedly
have been anxious to claim her as his wife. She
was a lady, and occupied a station in every way honorable
before this sad trouble overtook her; and I to-day, with
this to prove it, can claim a name as proud as any in England.
She was the daughter of the Marquis of Wycliffe, of whom
you have doubtless heard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it possible?” Miss Grafton exclaimed, greatly surprised;
“and you are therefore the heir of Wycliffe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but before I present my claim I have a work to
do. I must find him who wronged and ruined my mother’s
life,” he returned, with firmly compressed lips and lowering
brow.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Thank you for telling me this,” Miss Grafton said, wiping
the tears from her eyes. “I have often thought of the young
girl, of whom my father used frequently to speak, and wonder
if all was well with her. I congratulate you. I am
glad that the wrong-doer was outwitted, and that the innocent
will be righted at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My poor, innocent mother can never be righted; those
years of suffering and humiliation can never be atoned for,”
the young man said, in trembling tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friend,” Miss Isabel Grafton said, meeting his eyes
with a sweet gravity that was all her own, “can you not
<em>trust</em> that where she has gone all sorrow has ceased, all
tears are wiped, and that pain is remembered no more? <em>She</em>
can see now, if <em>you</em> cannot, why all this was permitted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Grafton, you remind me of my mother, only you
are younger—she used to talk that way to me, and she said
almost the same thing to me just before she died,” he said,
with a touch of reverence in his tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Grafton sighed, yet at the same time her lips parted
in a little tremulous smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sigh bespoke the memory of some bitter struggle of
the past—the smile of the trust and hope of which she had
just spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>She set before him a pen, ink, and paper, and then quietly
left the room while he copied those blessed words from the
rector’s diary, which in one hour had changed all his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as he had finished Miss Grafton returned to the parlor,
bringing a tempting little lunch for him, and chatted socially
with him while he ate it.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at last he arose to go, bade her farewell, and
thanked her again for her kindness, and then went away, she
for the first time losing all self-control, threw herself prone
upon the floor and cried aloud:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another, O Lord! Why in Thy mercy dost Thou permit
the brightest hopes to be destroyed, the happiest and most
innocent to suffer such cruel blight?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the story of another sweet woman’s life was told.</p>

<p class='c007'>Isabel Grafton’s own youth had been blasted, her own
heart crushed and broken by the treachery of one whom she
had trusted. She had loved and plighted herself to one who,
all unworthy, had deserted her for the brighter smiles of
another but the day before he was to have led her to the
altar.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>The son of Marion Vance went forth upon his self-imposed
mission—to find the man who had plotted to betray his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>mother, prove to him the validity of his marriage, and then,
leaving him forever, return to Wycliffe and claim his inheritance
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving him thus engaged, we must for a time turn our
thoughts in another direction—to Paul Tressalia, who was
called from Newport so suddenly, as already mentioned in
our story.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that on the same night of his final
rejection by Editha Dalton, he had received important letters
which demanded his immediate presence abroad, and that
summons, with his heart so sore from his disappointment,
he was only too glad to obey.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already explained how Paul Tressalia was related
to the Marquis of Wycliffe, his grandmother being the marquis’
only sister, and, should he die without issue, her heirs
would inherit the proud name and wealth belonging to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the blow came that destroyed all the marquis’ fond
hopes, and Marion Vance was driven forth from her home
to hide her disgrace, and bring up her illegitimate child far
from the immaculate precincts of Wycliffe, little Paul Tressalia,
then about six years of age, was at once acknowledged
the heir, and from that time educated accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the news of the sudden death of the marquis and
of his own succession to his vast property, both in France
and England, that had hastened his departure from Newport.</p>

<p class='c007'>This letter, by some unaccountable means, had been missent,
and did not reach him until more than a month after
his kinsman’s death, and so, without any delay, he hastened
to present himself at Wycliffe.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had never mentioned his prospects to any one during
his sojourn in America, where he had tarried longer by a
year than he at first intended, on account of his love for
Editha. So, although he was reported to be the heir to vast
wealth, no one really seemed to know just in what that wealth
consisted, or what his future prospects were. He was very
modest and unassuming regarding them, preferring to be accepted
solely upon his own merits wherever he went, rather
than upon the dignity of his prospective grandeur.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took possession of Wycliffe immediately upon his return
to England, and also of all the property belonging to the
previous marquis. And yet, in the midst of all his prosperity,
he was sad and depressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one woman whom he loved could not share it with
him, and all his bright prospects, like the apples of Sodom,
turned to ashes in his grasp.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Oh, my bright Editha!” he moaned, “why could you not
have loved me, when I could have given you everything
that would make life beautiful to you, when you are so
well fitted to grace the position you would have filled as my
wife? The beautiful things around me are but mockery—they
are nothing to me compared with the boon I crave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was his continual cry, and he would shut himself
away from every human eye for days, and battle with himself,
striving to conquer his hopeless love.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then it began to be whispered and suggested to him that
Wycliffe must have a mistress—he was over thirty, and it
was high time that some good, true woman came there to
reign, where for so many years there had been no mistress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, God!” he cried, after some one had spoken to him of
this; “I love but one—I cannot, I <em>will</em> not yield her place to
another! Must it be—is there no escape?” and his sense of
what was right and proper told him that it <em>ought</em> to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so several months went by, while all the county
yielded him homage, and every matron with a marriageable
damsel upon her hands showered upon him every attention
that her fertile brains could suggest.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day he was sitting alone in his library thinking of
this—and a magnificent room, be it known, was this library
at Wycliffe, furnished with ebony, upholstered in olive,
green, and gold. The rich ebony bookcase, inlaid with pearl
and precious woods, reached from ceiling to floor, and were
filled with countless volumes, each collection bound in uniform
covers. It had been the pride of the previous marquis’
heart, his one solace and comfort, after his bitter
trouble came upon him, and he had spent the greater part
of his life there among his choice books.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it seemed likely also to be the resort of Paul Tressalia,
for here he brought himself and his troubles, and, locked
within his fort, no one dared to intrude; and, as he sat there
one morning thinking bitterly of what might have been, a
servant came to the door and knocked for admittance. With
a shrug and frown of impatience, he arose and went to the
door, where he was handed a card.</p>

<p class='c007'>It bore the name of a noted lawyer from London—“Archibald
Faxon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Show him in,” the young marquis said, with a weary sigh
at being obliged to see any one, and wondering what this
noted stranger could want of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hon. Archibald Faxon soon made his appearance—a
wiry, sharp-featured man, with a keen, restless eye that
was capable of reading a man through almost instantly—any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>one would have known he was a lawyer, and a successful
one, too, merely to look at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young marquis greeted him with a show of cordiality,
and then politely waited for him to state his business.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not long in coming to the point.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fear I have come to you upon a very unpleasant errand,”
he said, suavely, and yet with an appearance of regret in
his manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed!” was Paul Tressalia’s indifferent reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>It did not appear to him that anything could move him
after what he had already suffered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, your lordship; I have to present to you the claims
of another to this property of Wycliffe, and all other properties
connected with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia regarded the man with almost stupid wonder
for a moment. A more ridiculous assertion, it struck
him, could not have been made by the most witless fool
in the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, I do not understand you,” he managed to say, at last.</p>

<p class='c007'>The noted Mr. Faxon very deliberately and distinctly repeated
his statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you aware how very absurd such an assertion sounds,
Mr. Faxon?” Paul Tressalia asked, with curling lips. “Why,
I am the only living representative of the whole family,
and what you assert is simply preposterous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so much so as you may suppose,” returned the lawyer,
calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia began to grow rather red in the face at
this; he could not exactly make out whether the lawyer
meant to insult him or not; his manner was courteous, but
what he said was such an unheard of proposition that he was
at a loss to comprehend it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that is the nature of your business with me to-day, you
will excuse me if I say I cannot listen to you any further,”
he said, rather coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bear with me, if you please, my lord, for a few moments,”
returned the imperturbable lawyer, with a wave of
his shapely hand, “and allow me to ask you a few questions.
Did not the former marquis have an only child?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but she forfeited all claim to the property according
to the conditions of the entail, and was disowned by her
father more than twenty years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That child gave birth to a son, I’ve been told?” remarked
Mr. Faxon, not heeding Mr. Tressalia’s last statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I really cannot say whether it was a son or daughter,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>he answered, his lips curling again just a trifle. “Whichever
it was, it was illegitimate, and could inherit nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it had been born in wedlock it would have inherited
the property which you now hold, would it not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but it was <em>not</em> born in wedlock, consequently all this
argument is utterly useless,” the young marquis said, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you <em>quite sure</em>, my lord, of the truth of what you
assert?” was the next unruffled query.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly; it is according to Miss Vance’s own confession
to her father; she owned she had been deceived, and that
only a mock marriage had been consummated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it not barely possible that Miss Vance herself may
have been mistaken in the matter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think <em>not</em>, when interests of so vital importance
were at stake,” Paul Tressalia answered, with something very
like a sneer upon his fine face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question was so utterly devoid of sense and reason,
at least to him, that he could not control it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it is my duty to prove to you that such <em>was</em> the
case, notwithstanding. May I ask your attention to some
documents which I have in my possession?” and the lawyer,
with great deference, drew forth a package from his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>With an expression of incredulity upon his handsome face,
Paul Tressalia drew up his chair to the table, to comply
with his request.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spread them before him, and immediately entered upon
an explanation of their contents, going over them step by
step until, in spite of his unbelief, the young marquis’ face
grew grave, anxious, and perplexed, and he began to fear
that his fair inheritance, his proud name and title, were in
danger of being wrested from him after all.</p>

<p class='c007'>He read the certificate signed so boldly by Joshua Grafton,
bishop, and rector of St. John’s parish, and which had been
given to Marion upon the completion of the marriage ceremony,
and which also she had regarded only as so much
worthless paper; yet some unaccountable instinct had always
prevented her destroying it whenever she had been tempted
to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>He carefully read those extracts which Marion’s son had
made from the rector’s diary, and with which we are so
familiar. He listened with painful interest to the repetition
of the sexton’s story of his confession, and how he
became a witness to the marriage ceremony, and he could
scarcely credit his own sense of hearing as he heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>marvelous tale, and his better judgment told him that every
word was true.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when one is already suffering, as he was suffering,
with his heart so sore and bitter, one’s natural antagonism
and rebellion against the iron hand of fate is more easily
aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it was now with Paul Tressalia; he had been obliged
to relinquish his dearest hopes—to give up the woman he
loved; and now, with this almost incontestable evidence
before him, it seemed as if every hope of his manhood was
destined to be crushed; and, with a strange perversity, even
in the face of such stern facts as had just been presented
to him, he said within himself that he <em>would not yield</em> his
inheritance to this unknown child of Marion Vance—he
<em>would not</em> give up his position, his wealth, his proud and
honored name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a cunningly devised fable,” he said, with a stern,
white face, “and I defy the claim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry, my lord; for, with all my experience in
the law, I must say I never undertook a clearer case,” the
Hon. Mr. Faxon replied, with the same unvarying politeness
that he had displayed all through the interview.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nevertheless, I shall resist to the uttermost of my ability.
Tell your client so. He will have to fight a mighty hard
battle before he will win one foot of Wycliffe,” the young
marquis returned, moodily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is prepared to do so, if necessary, your lordship, for
his mother’s sake alone. He has expressed deep regret
at your disappointment, but <em>her</em> honor and purity must be
established at all events, whether he wins anything else
or not. He will at once take measures to establish the
validity of her marriage, that all who formerly knew her
may know that no shadow of stain rests upon her character.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is he? Where has he been all these years? Where
is he now?” demanded the marquis, with clouded brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw the reasonableness of what the young man contemplated,
and knew that if those facts were once established
there would be no hope left for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Until about seven years ago he resided with his mother
in ——, a little town in the southwest of England. After
her death, prompted by curiosity, he visited the place where
she believed she had been so grossly deceived, and accidentally
stumbled upon the evidence with which I have presented
you to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then his mother knew nothing of all this?—she believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>up to the time of her death that she had forfeited all claim
to this property?” Mr. Tressalia inquired, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most assuredly, or she would have returned immediately
to her father and vindicated herself, for the sake of her
child’s future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did he not present himself to his grandfather, then,
as soon as he made this discovery?” the marquis inquired,
thinking it very strange that he had not done so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His first impulse was to do so. But he is very proud—he
inherits all the fire and spirit of his race—and, feeling
very sore and indignant at the treatment which his mother
received from his grandfather, he naturally shrank from him.
Moreover, he concluded that his first duty was to find the
man who had so wronged him and her, and notify him of the
validity of the marriage which he had supposed to be but a
sham.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he succeed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did not, although he has used every means in his
power to discover the man’s place of residence, and whether
he was living or dead. He would not now present his claim
to this property, but recently learning of the death of his
grandfather, he deemed it best to establish his identity and
continue his search afterward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is rather late in the day; he should have come immediately
upon the marquis’ death, and before I had taken
possession,” Paul Tressalia said, with some excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He would have done so had it been possible; but it
is only a fortnight since he learned that fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On your honor as a gentleman, do you believe the statements
you have made to me to-day?” the marquis asked,
after considering the matter in a long and thoughtful pause,
and fixing his eyes keenly upon the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On my honor as a gentleman, and <em>as a friend</em> of the
previous Marquis of Wycliffe, I have not a single doubt upon
the subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are only copies,” Mr. Tressalia said, laying his
hand upon the papers before him. “Have you seen the
original, written in the hand of Bishop Grafton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have, and examined them carefully.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does his signature there correspond with this upon the
certificate of marriage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly; except that this is written in rather a bolder
hand. I have also seen the sexton and questioned him
closely,” Mr. Faxon returned, feeling deeply for the young
man, who was to lose so much upon the proof of these facts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Where did you say the claimant is at this time?” Paul
Tressalia asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here at Wycliffe, awaiting an interview with yourself.
I think you will find him disposed to be very considerate
and generous with you in his dealings; and you will acknowledge
that, despite the obscurity in which he has been reared,
he is an honor to your race. Shall I bring him to you now?”
Mr. Faxon asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please; I am ready to meet him now,” Paul Tressalia
said, with a weary sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lawyer immediately arose and left the room, but returned
again almost instantly, accompanied by a tall, handsome
stranger, whose peculiarly noble and attractive face
at once riveted Paul Tressalia’s eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” the Hon Archibald Faxon said, in his most
gracious manner, “allow me to present to you my client,
who is also your relative, and by the name his mother gave
him—<em>Earle Wayne</em>!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI<br> <span class='large'>THE BATTLE WON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the great library at Wycliffe three strongly contrasted
men had met to solve one of life’s most complex problems.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia, the present master of Wycliffe, was face
to face with the grim possibility of being turned out of his
estates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hon. Archibald Faxon, a famous London lawyer, had
entered the library a moment before and introduced to the
astounded Paul Tressalia a claimant in the shape of a cousin
upon whose name had rested the shadow of shame.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was not simply this that had driven the blood from
Paul Tressalia’s face. It was the fact that the lawyer had
introduced his client as “Earle Wayne.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Earle Wayne!</em>” repeated Paul Tressalia, in a startled
tone, a sharp, sudden pain running throughout his frame at
the name as he remembered an interview with pretty Editha
Dalton, and instantly knew that his rival for her love, and
the claimant for his supposed inheritance, were one and the
same person.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then quickly recovering himself, he greeted his kinsman
with the courtesy that always characterized him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir,” explained the lawyer; “every one is aware
that the Marquis of Wycliffe possessed another title—Viscount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Wayne. When Miss Vance—or, I should now more
properly say, Mrs. Sumner—left her father’s house, under
the impression that she had been lured into a mock marriage,
she could not endure the thought of retaining the name by
which she had always been known, and, feeling utterly unable
to renounce <em>every</em> tie that bound her to the old life, she
adopted the name of Mrs. Wayne as one little likely to attract
attention, and, when her son was born, bestowed upon him
that of Earle Wayne, and which he always believed belonged
to him by right, until his mother lay upon her death-bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time in his life Earle Wayne stood in the
home of his mother—in the halls of his ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>From what he had learned of Paul Tressalia, he admired
and honored him as one of earth’s noblest men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” he said, as he held him by the hand and courteously
addressed him, by the title which more rightly belonged
to himself, “I regret more than I can express the necessity
that brings me here to-day. Believe me, I care little for the
advantages I may reap upon the establishment of my claim
compared with the vindication of my innocent mother, who
suffered so long in silence and obscurity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was frankly spoken, and the regret expressed was real,
there could be no doubt of it, while the title he had used
did not escape the notice of either the lawyer or Paul Tressalia.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can scarcely realize it,” the latter said, passing his hand
wearily across his brow and speaking with white lips. “Are
you the Mr. Wayne who—who——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who for the last seven years has resided in the city of
New York, in the United States,” Earle hastened to say, to
fill up the awkward pause, and knowing but too well of
what he was thinking.</p>

<p class='c007'>He felt deeply for him, and it was a very trying moment
for even the noblest nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes!” Paul Tressalia said, and then bowed his head
upon his breast and sat apparently lost in thought for many
minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hon. Archibald Faxon regarded them in astonishment.
He had not supposed that either knew anything personally
of the other until this moment, and never dreamed of the
romance so closely woven into their lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Wayne,” Paul Tressalia said at last, lifting his face,
which seemed to have grown suddenly old, and turning it full
upon Earle, “will you allow me a few hours in which to think
this matter over alone before we talk further upon it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was nearly unmanned and crushed beneath this avalanche
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of stern facts and bitter trouble which had come
so suddenly upon him, and he must be alone for awhile, or
he knew he should break down utterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, as long as you like,” Earle said, with hearty
kindness, adding: “I have no desire to inconvenience you in
any way. Take a week, a month, or even longer, if you
wish, and I will meet you again at any place and time you
see fit to designate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; you are very kind; and if you have no other
engagement for to-day, I will give you my decision this afternoon.
Meantime, the horses and carriages in the stables are
at your service. You can go over the estate, or occupy yourselves
in any way agreeable to you,” Paul Tressalia replied,
with grave courtesy.</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose, gathered up the papers the lawyer had brought,
then, with a bow to both gentlemen, withdrew from the room
and sought his private apartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once there, and all doors securely locked, his firmness deserted
him utterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Can</em> I bear it?” he groaned, sinking into a chair and
dropping his head upon the table. “Can I <em>ever</em> bear it, that
she should be his wife? I must, for she loves him, and
though to lose her rends my soul, yet <em>I</em> love <em>her</em> so well
that to see her happy I would not shrink from any suffering
however great. But can I bear to lose all <em>this</em>, and have him
here at Wycliffe, where <em>I</em> had hoped to bring her as its mistress
and <em>my</em> wife? I <em>cannot</em> bear it!” he cried aloud, beating
the air wildly with his hands, his face convulsed with
pain. “I was proud of my inheritance,” he went on; “I was
proud of my name and position, and hoped to rule wisely and
well over the trust committed to my care. <em>Can I give it up?</em>
I had hoped to make the proud name I bear even more
honorable and revered; I had hoped to make it, wherever it
was uttered, the synonym for virtue, truth, and probity.
Must I surrender all these aspirations, and calmly lay down
every ambitious desire. <em>If</em> I yield, <em>he</em> will marry <em>her</em> at once,
and bring her here. She will indeed be mistress of Wycliffe;
but, oh! how differently from what I wished! I <em>cannot</em> bear
it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He sprang to his feet and paced back and forth, fighting
his agony and rebellious heart as only men of his character
can fight and suffer.</p>

<p class='c007'>For more than two hours he argued the case with himself
in every possible light, and then, with an expression strong
as iron upon his marble face, and eyes that glowed with a
relentless purpose, he drew his chair again to the table, sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>down, unfolded the papers he had brought with him, and for
another hour studied them intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s lawyer—though himself a successful lawyer, he
yet deemed that he needed maturer judgment than his own
upon this case, and in a strange country, and so had sought
one of the best—had prepared a clear and succinct account
of Marion Vance’s whole history, as related to him by his
client, from the time of her leaving her home to visit her
friends at Rye, until her death. This, with the certificate
of marriage, and the extracts from the old rector’s journal,
and the sexton’s tale, made everything so plain that Paul
Tressalia could not doubt the truth of what he read.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not for a moment question Earle Wayne’s identity,
as many might have done, and seize this as a weapon with
which to fight him.</p>

<p class='c007'>That he was the son of Marion Vance seemed to him a
self-evident fact. He resembled the former marquis in form,
in his proud bearing, his clear-cut, Roman features, his grand
and noble head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marion had resembled her mother, but the blood of the
Vance race showed itself clearly enough in Earle, and Paul
had recognized it at once upon beholding him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only point he had been at all inclined to doubt was
the validity of the marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this point was established now, if the lawyer’s statement
was correct, and the extracts <i><span lang="la">bona fide</span></i>; and that
could be easily ascertained by comparing the signatures upon
the certificate with the writing in the rector’s diary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall go and read that account for myself, and if all
this is true, what shall I do?” the sorely-tried man asked
himself for the hundredth time.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then, as his mind leaped forward into the future
again, and he saw Earle established in the halls of his ancestors,
proud, prosperous, and happy, with Editha Dalton
as his wife, and sunny-haired, merry-hearted children playing
about them, he covered his face, and writhing with pain,
groaned again. Then a miserable temptation beset him; his
rebellious heart refusing to bear patiently the crushing burdens
imposed upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Possession is nine points in law—hold on to the Wycliffe
estates with a grasp of iron as long as your strength holds
out—defy this new and hitherto unknown claimant until the
very last,” whispered the evil spirit within him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What good would it do? He must win in the end,” he opposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you can keep him out of it for years, perhaps, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>all the while enjoy the luxuries you have so fondly believed
your own. He has won <em>her</em> love away from you; it is not
fair that he should have everything and you nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no true love without sacrifice,” came to him as
if softly wafted upon the breath of some good angel. “If
you truly love Editha Dalton—if it is a pure and unselfish
love, you will do <em>right</em> and let her be happy, no matter what
the cost is to yourself. Would she respect you? Would
she honor you? Would she be proud to call you friend, as
she once said, if, convinced of the right, you wilfully do
wrong?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he said, with uplifted head, and speaking aloud, as
if some one had spoken directly to him; “<em>I’ll keep my manhood
pure, even though I am beggared by the result.</em>”</p>

<p class='c007'>A noble spirit of self-abnegation and sacrifice arose within
him; the battle was won, but his heart was broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha Dalton should spend her life without a shadow to
mar its brightness, as far as it lay within his power to contribute
to that result; and Earle Wayne—a true and noble
man he believed him to be, and every way worthy of her
priceless love—should have his own without contention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wycliffe will have a noble master,” he murmured; “he
will add brightness and honor to the name—perhaps more
than I could have done. I will try to bear it patiently; I will
give her my blessing with my inheritance, and then, when
I come to the crossing ’twixt earth and the great beyond,
I can pass over without a regret. I shall have done right and
what was my duty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He sighed heavily and threw himself upon a couch, as if
exhausted with the struggle; and the good angels watching
him must have come to comfort him, for almost unconsciously
his eyes closed, and sleep wrapped him for the time in the
mantle of forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did they whisper to him that almost divine message from
some sweet, mystic pen:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, fear not in a world like this,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And thou shalt know ere long—</div>
      <div class='line'>Know how sublime a thing it is</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To suffer and be strong?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He had ordered dinner to be served at three o’clock. A
little before that time he awoke, and went down to his guests
the calm, self-contained, courteous host.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dinner-hour passed pleasantly and socially, the three
gentlemen conversing unreservedly upon the topics of the
day.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>When at length they arose from the table, Paul Tressalia
requested a few minutes’ private conversation with
Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was cordially granted, and they repaired to the library
again, while the Hon. Archibald Faxon lingered upon the
dining-room balcony smoking his fragrant Havana.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a moment’s awkward silence as those two claimants
of the Wycliffe property stood facing each other; then
Paul Tressalia frankly extended his hand, which Earle cordially
grasped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not often that rivals, such as you and I are <em>in every
sense of the word</em>, can shake hands thus,” said the former,
with a smile. “I will confess to you that I have had a bitter
struggle with my own heart during the last few hours, but
I have conquered myself. I am obliged to be convinced
of the truth of the evidence you have brought me to-day,
and, looking in your face, which unmistakably proclaims your
relationship to the late marquis, I know that you are nearer
of kin to him than I. Of course, I shall take pains to ascertain
everything regarding the rector’s story for myself, and
that the signatures are all right, and so forth. If there is
nothing there to contradict your statements, I shall at once
yield my position here, and you will henceforth be recognized
as the Marquis of Wycliffe and Viscount Wayne.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle could scarcely credit his sense of hearing as he
listened to this noble renunciation of all the brightest prospects
of his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had believed that he should be obliged to have recourse
to the extent of the law in order to establish his
claim, and now its possessor was giving up everything without
a demur. He could only look the astonishment that
he could not speak. Again Paul Tressalia smiled—a smile
that was sadder than tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You look surprised at my decision,” he said; “you expected
I would resist your claim. I suppose I might, if
I were so disposed, and thus make you much trouble; but
that would not be right, convinced as I am that you are what
you say—the legitimate son of Marion Vance and George
Sumner; and for the sake of one whom we both love—you
fortunately, I most unfortunately—I will not place one
obstacle in your path.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was deeply moved by his kinsman’s manliness, and
touched by his confession of his hopeless love for Editha.
Still clasping the hand that had been extended so frankly
to him, he said, in a voice that was not quite steady:</p>

<p class='c007'>“With such a spirit as that, <em>you</em> should be master here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>at Wycliffe, and not I. It seems to me unjust that your whole
life should be destroyed thus, and mine built up out of its
ruins. If it were possible for me to share my inheritance
with you equally, I would gladly do it; but I suppose the
entail forbids that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it could not be, even if I were willing to accept such
an obligation,” Paul Tressalia said, not unkindly, yet with
a little show of spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle regarded him with admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have heard of you before—how true and good you are,
and I am proud to know that I have <em>one</em> such relative in the
world. If you cannot accept any aid from me, will you
not stay with me as my adviser, my elder brother, my
friend?” he said, in low, earnest tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Tressalia shook his head, a look of pain leaping to
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fear that would not be possible,” he said; “your own
heart will tell you that I could not remain here after—after
you come here permanently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle saw that it could not be, and sighed. He longed
to comfort him, but what could he say?</p>

<p class='c007'>Delicacy forbade his expressing any pity for his suffering
and loss, for that would be but vaunting his own happiness
and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can be friends, can we not?” he asked wistfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most assuredly. I shall be glad to claim your friendship,
and will aid you in everything as far as I am able; believe
me, I bear you no ill-will because brighter stars beam
upon your way than upon mine just now. You have suffered
in the past and borne it like a hero, and I am truly glad
that your future is so promising.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tears stood in Earle’s eyes as he said, with a burst of
enthusiasm:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Paul Tressalia, <em>you</em> are a hero! You make me think
of those lines by Joseph Addison:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Unbounded courage and compassion joined,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tempering each other in the victor’s mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alternately proclaim him good and great,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make the hero and the man complete.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“You make me out greater than I am,” was the sad reply,
as he remembered the terrible thoughts and temptations that
had come to him a few hours before. “I cannot deny,” he
continued, after a slight pause, “that I am bitterly disappointed—that
it is a trial almost greater than I can bear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>lose all I had so firmly believed to be mine—that I had grown
up from youth believing <em>would</em> be mine! and had I the least
idea now that your claim was invalid, I should do battle
valiantly before I would yield up one foot of my possessions
to you. Human nature will assert itself, you know,
and I am conscious that I am not above its weaknesses. But,
Earle, I mean to fight them down until, with the last one
under my heel, I shall be able at length to cheerfully contemplate
God’s richest blessings abiding on you and—yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The last word was spoken in a hoarse whisper, and his
companion realized that all the force of a mighty will had
been employed to let him know how entirely he relinquished
everything and acknowledged his superior claim, even to
Editha Dalton’s love.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia could bear no more, and, wringing Earle’s
hand, he went quickly away, leaving him alone and deeply
moved.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII<br> <span class='large'>THE SEARCH FOR EDITHA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Three months later saw Earle Wayne firmly established as
the master of Wycliffe, and over all other property belonging
to the former Marquis of Wycliffe and Viscount Wayne.
His mother’s character was cleared of every imputation of
evil, her body removed to the vaults of her ancestors, where
it rested as peacefully and quietly as the noblest of all the
race of Vance, and the friends of her youth now looked
back with sadness and regret upon the sufferings of the
beautiful injured girl, which their own sneers and coldness
had helped to aggravate.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this change made no small stir in the social world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia first of all went down to Winchelsea, where
he interviewed the old sexton of St. John’s Chapel, who
told him exactly the same story that he had told Earle seven
years before. He next sought Miss Isabel Grafton, and
craved permission to peruse her father’s diary.</p>

<p class='c007'>She received him with the same graciousness that she
had accorded Earle, and talked long and freely with him
upon the strange, sad events of Marion Vance’s history,
while he in return related much regarding Earle’s manly
battling with the cold world, omitting, of course, that sad
epoch wherein he, too, had suffered so much for another’s
wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>In a simple, manly fashion he mentioned the fact that the
establishment of his young kinsman’s identity dethroned him
from Wycliffe and one of the proudest positions in England,
and Miss Grafton’s expressions of sincere regret and sympathy
were the sweetest and most comforting sounds that had
fallen on his ear since that night when Editha Dalton had
crushed his last hope of ever winning her love.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that
Earle was the rightful heir, and he gave up everything to
his possession without a demur; and then, out of the nobility
of his nature, took upon himself the defense of Marion
Vance’s character.</p>

<p class='c007'>He caused a notice of the marriage to be inserted in all
the leading papers, with the date of the event, wrote a brief
and simple account of the manner in which it had occurred,
the wrong that had been attempted but fortunately outwitted,
and how at last the real heir, her son, had been restored to
his rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long after this before the whole world—Marion’s
world—knew of her innocence, and immediately
recognized and cordially received Earle as Marquis of Wycliffe
and Viscount Wayne.</p>

<p class='c007'>This accomplished, Earle’s impatient heart told him he
now might return to Editha and claim the reward of all
his patient waiting, and to make one last effort to discover
the criminals for whom he had so unjustly suffered.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not dream that when he should inform Mr. Dalton
of the great change in his prospects, and the position to
which he had attained, he would longer withhold his consent
to his marriage with his daughter; and so it was with a light
heart that he left Paul Tressalia to rule at Wycliffe until his
return, and set sail for the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “wings of the wind” were not half rapid enough to
bear him thither, for, for several weeks past, his heart
had been filled with great anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s letters had suddenly ceased, and though he wrote
again and again, it was ever with the same result—not one
came in reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not for a moment doubt her constancy; he knew
she simply <em>could not</em> be untrue to him, and he was forced
to believe that Mr. Dalton had discovered the fact of their
correspondence, and had taken measures to stop it, in perhaps
the same way that he had before intercepted her flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The passage across the Atlantic was an unusually long one,
owing to unfavorable winds and storms, and he was nearly
sick with the delay and his patience exhausted, when at last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the vessel touched her pier, and he sprang ashore like a restless
bird escaped from its cage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two hours later he stood on the steps of Mr. Dalton’s
residence, his heart beating with a strange, unaccountable
fear of something wrong, though he knew not what.</p>

<p class='c007'>A servant answered his impatient ring, and to his eager
inquiry, “Is Miss Dalton at home?” returned a surprised
“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then inquired for Mr. Dalton, and the reply suddenly
stilled his rapid heart-beats and drove every shade of color
from his face and lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, Mr. Dalton is not at home; he has been searching
for Miss Dalton ever since her strange disappearance,”
the man said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Strange disappearance!</em> Man! what do you mean?”
gasped Earle, actually staggering beneath the unexpected
blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The servant, pitying his distress, asked him to come in,
saying he would tell him all about the affair.</p>

<p class='c007'>He mechanically obeyed, and his heart nearly died within
him as he listened to the strange account of her sudden disappearance
and protracted absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing had been heard of her during all that time beyond
what has already been related in a previous chapter,
although every one reasoned, from the account which the
policeman gave of her encounter with the ruffian on her return
from John Loker’s house, that <em>he</em> must have had something
to do with it, since she seemed to possess something
that he was bound to have, and she as determined not to
relinquish.</p>

<p class='c007'>The detectives employed to unravel the mystery could learn
nothing; they were baffled at every point. They would seem
to gain a clew to her whereabouts, and then would suddenly
lose it again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her fate remained a dark and perplexing mystery, and
seemed likely to remain so indefinitely, and it had created
a great deal of excitement, not only in her own city but all
over the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first Earle inclined to think that Mr. Dalton himself
was criminally concerned in the affair, remembering as he
did his excessive anger upon discovering that Editha had
promised to be his wife, and also his insulting language,
sneers, and sarcasm both to her and him the day before
his departure for Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>But after he had seen and conversed with Mr. Felton,
Editha’s lawyer, he changed his mind upon this point.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Mr. Felton asserted that Mr. Dalton was now traveling
in search of her, and had been unwearied in his efforts to
find her ever since her disappearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>He privately informed him also that his business affairs
were inextricably involved, and that for a long time he
had been dependent upon Editha’s income, which she had
freely and generously shared with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, however, since she was of age and controlled her
property, he would be cut off from that source of supply
until she was found, as Mr. Felton had no right to pay
over anything to him without her sanction; so it was for his
interest that he exert every effort in his power to find her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s every interest and thought for himself was now
also swallowed up in this great and unexpected trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>He no longer thought of seeking those unpunished criminals,
or of clearing his own name from dishonor.</p>

<p class='c007'>What cared he for any disgrace that might cling to <em>him</em>,
so long as <em>her</em> fate remained such a dark mystery, and she,
perhaps, sick and suffering, or—dead, for all any one would
ever know?</p>

<p class='c007'>For a week he was nearly mad, neither eating nor sleeping,
but wandering aimlessly about the streets, peering into every
face he met, as if he hoped that by some chance he might
meet her. At night he was like some restless, caged lion,
helplessly shut in by the darkness, as it were, behind its bars,
against which he constantly fretted and fumed, until, with
the first sign of dawn, he could return to his vain search.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at the end of a week he began to realize the uselessness
of his present course and then determined to settle
down to some methodical plan upon which to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>He resolved that he would visit very town, village and
hamlet in the State, and that failing, he would search every
other State in the Union in the same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, this would entail upon him a life-long search,
and the detectives told him he would only have his labor
for his pains—that he would never find her in that way.
They held to the belief that she was either in that city, or
else in one of the adjoining cities, and within easy reach of
the great metropolis, and they declared that they should confine
their efforts to those places.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle wrote something of all this to Paul Tressalia, begging
him to remain and rule at Wycliffe until his return, even
though it should not be for a long time, and then he began
his weary search.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be wearisome in the extreme to follow him, step
by step, through the long weeks that followed, and during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>which he spared neither himself nor his money. He grew
pale, thin and nervous, and disheartened, too, as the time
went by, and he seemed no nearer the accomplishment of his
object than at the very first.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What shall I do?” he wrote, almost in despair, to Mr.
Felton from a distant town. “I am nearly distracted, for
all my efforts are vain. I have interviewed a number of
detectives in different cities, and no two advise the same
mode of procedure, and have advanced so many plans and
theories that I am like a ship far out at sea, without either
rudder or sail. I suffer continually the tortures of the rack.
There is no rest for me, and there will be no charm in
life for me until I find my lost one. Can you give me any
hope? Has any clew been discovered? Telegraph me instantly
if there is a single ray of hope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor fellow!” the lawyer sighed, as he folded the letter
after reading it; “it is a hard case. It is a most <em>trying</em> case,
and no one can tell how it will end,” he mused, “else, with
her resolution and natural keenness, it seems as if she must
have found some way of giving us a hint of her whereabouts
if she is detained anywhere against her will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But he could only telegraph to Earle: “No clew has yet
been discovered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the weary lover resumed his sad quest by himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>But poor, frail humanity cannot endure everything; there
is a point beyond which tired nature refuses to go, and at
last, worn almost to a shadow, Earle felt that he must do
something to recruit his strength, or he would give out entirely.
A fever seemed to be burning in his veins, drying
his blood and parching his skin; his appetite failed him, his
strength was leaving him, and he grew so nervous and irritable
that the slightest noise startled him painfully, the least
opposition or disappointment tried him almost beyond endurance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to be sick,” he said one day, when he was
nearly prostrated, and looking at his thin, trembling hands.
“This anxiety and ceaseless search are fast wearing me out.
I must rest, or I shall die, and who then will find my Editha?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Longing for the sight of some familiar face, and hoping
that Mr. Felton might by this time be able to give him a
“drop of comfort,” he returned with all speed to the city
whence he had started.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arriving in the evening, some unaccountable repugnance
to repairing to the hotel where he usually stopped, and
where he had before spent so many restless, miserable nights,
seized him, and calling a coach, he gave the name of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>smaller, but no less respectable house, located in a quiet
street, and was driven thither.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sought the clerk and asked for a room.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it happened, the hotel that week was overflowing with
transient visitors, and at first the clerk told him that there
was not a room to be had in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must manage some way to accommodate me, for
I am too weary and ill to move another step,” Earle said;
and indeed his looks did not belie his words.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clerk went to consult with one of the proprietors,
and then returned, saying they would give him a room in
which to sleep that night, if he did not mind a little noise
now and then, and by another day there would probably be
better accommodations for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall mind nothing, so that I can have a bed on which
to rest,” the tired traveler said, much relieved by the intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall have to give you one of a suite of rooms hired by
a lady and her daughter. It is reserved for her son, who
occasionally visits her and remains over night. He went
away this morning, and, as he probably will not be here
to-night, you can have that room,” explained the clerk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will not the madam object?” Earle asked, instinctively
recoiling from the idea of in any way incommoding a lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; we have done the same thing, with her consent,
once or twice before, when the house has been full,” was
the confident and reassuring reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right; I am ready to occupy it at once,” Earle said,
rising, and anxious to be at rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clerk hesitated before leading the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ought perhaps to tell you, sir,” he began, “that madam’s
daughter is an invalid—she is a little cracked,” he added,
touching his forehead significantly, “and sometimes takes on
a little during the night. I thought you ought to be told this,
so that if you were disturbed you might know the cause and
not be alarmed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The door between the rooms can be locked, of course?”
Earle asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes; madam keeps it locked on her side, and there
is also a bolt upon the other side. The young lady is perfectly
harmless, only her brother informed me that when the
spells come upon her she moans constantly, as if in distress,
and they come on mostly in the night. She may not disturb
you at all, however.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not mind it, now that you have told me this; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>might have disturbed me otherwise,” Earle answered, as he
wearily turned to follow his guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking the elevator, they were borne into the fourth story,
and he was shown into a room at the top of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a long, rather narrow room, comfortably furnished,
and having two doors to it, one leading into the hall, the
other into the room adjoining. There was a transom over
both doors, and through the one leading into the others of the
suite Earle could see a dim light, but all was perfectly quiet
within.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked to see that the bolt was perfectly fast in its
socket, and then, giving his neighbors no further thought,
he hastily disrobed, and, wearied out, crept into bed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br> <span class='large'>EARLE WAYNE’S BOLD VENTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He almost instantly fell into a profound and dreamless
slumber.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long he slept thus he could not have told, but he was
suddenly awakened during the night by a low, sobbing noise
proceeding from the room on his right.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arousing so suddenly, and being consequently somewhat
confused, it seemed to him at first as if some one had called
his name.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sat erect in bed and listened.</p>

<p class='c007'>All was silence for a few moments, then he heard the
tones of a man speaking as if in anger, and the same low
sobbing instantly began again, while a sweet voice seemed
pleading for something.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he heard the man’s voice somewhat louder, and
speaking impatiently, as if he had commanded some one to
do something, and had not been obeyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was followed, as before, by the low sobbing, and a faint,
heart-broken moaning that made Earle Wayne feel very
strangely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is something wrong going on in there,” he muttered
to himself. “The clerk said the man would not return here
to-night; but it seems he has, and I don’t like the sound of
things at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose and went softly to the door which led into the
other apartment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>It was a very thick, solid door, and prevented his hearing
distinctly anything that was said.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bent his head to the keyhole, but even then could only
catch the sound of a man and woman conversing in low tones,
without distinguishing a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sobbing had ceased for the moment, but, at a question
apparently addressed to a third party, it immediately began
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cold sweat gathered upon Earle Wayne’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sounds affected him as he had never been affected
before. He longed to know what piece of wickedness—for
wickedness he was convinced it was—was being enacted
within those walls at that time of night.</p>

<p class='c007'>A faint light from the other room shone into his through
the transom, so that he could distinguish every object in
it. He glanced up at the light, a sudden thought striking
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transom, of course, was glazed, and he had no doubt
that it was fastened upon the other side, but possibly he might
hear a little more distinctly if he could get up to it, and it
would do no harm for him to investigate and see if it was
fastened.</p>

<p class='c007'>He brought the center-table and put it softly down by the
door. He then took a blanket from his bed and covered
the marble top, set a chair upon this, and then noiselessly
mounting upon that by the aid of another, he found himself
upon a level with the transom.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his intense satisfaction, he discovered that it was not
fastened; it was tightly closed, but it yielded beneath his
cautious touch, and he knew if he could open it ever so
little without attracting the attention of the occupants of
that room, he could satisfy himself regarding the nature of
the proceedings there.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he stood there waiting for a favorable opportunity
to push the transom open, a neighboring clock struck the hour
of two.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unless the young lady has been taken suddenly sick, I
am satisfied that mischief of some kind is brewing,” he said
to himself, and resolving not to leave his post until he had
ascertained whether he was right or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found he could hear more plainly now—could catch
a word occasionally, though not enough to give him any idea
of the nature of the conversation carried on there.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as he heard that low sobbing again he gently
tried to move the transom still more.</p>

<p class='c007'>It yielded a trifle, but grated a little on the wood work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>He waited a moment, and then made another effort, and
it moved just enough to admit a line of light at the bottom.
Then he could hear quite plainly.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man seemed to be asking the strangest questions of some
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your name is Ellen Wood?” he heard him say, in a mocking
tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Ellen Wood,” came the reply, in a plaintive voice
that made Earle’s hair at once stand on end.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are <em>sure</em> your name is Ellen Wood?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Ellen Wood,” in the same tone as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where were you born?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In Texas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is your father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judge Allen Wood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is this woman?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is my—mother,” with a shuddering accent on the
last word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I am your brother, am I not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“N-n-o, oh!” a gasping voice uttered, with a moan between
each word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ain’t over fond of me, I see,” the man returned, with
a low, mocking laugh. “You’ve got your lesson pretty well
learned, though, and if any one should ask you any questions
to-morrow when you go out to take the air—as you
must do for the sake of your health—you’ll know how to answer
them. Now take that ring from your finger and give it
to me,” he commanded, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t, I can’t!” moaned the plaintive voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Curse your obstinacy and my lack of power!” he growled.
“Now tell me where that paper is—quick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, no! no, no, no!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And immediately the sobbing and moaning were resumed,
but in a way that seemed to show that the speaker’s strength
was almost exhausted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man swore a fearful oath, and then Earle heard another
voice—a woman’s—say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s of no use, Tom—your power is not strong enough
to make her tell that, and you are wearing her out; she can’t
stand this kind of thing much longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll never let her go until she does tell me,” he answered,
fiercely, with another oath. “If I was sure,” he added, “that
it was hid in that house, I’d go and burn it down to-night,
and then let her go. I’m sick and tired of the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Better let her go anyway, and run the risk,” said his
companion; “you will soon kill her at this rate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dead men tell no tales,” he answered, moodily; “but the
risk is too great, for if that paper contains a description of
me, I’m a marked man as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle now ventured to push the transom a little more.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was clear of the wood work, now, and swung quite
easily and noiselessly, so that he could get a good view of
the room, and he saw a sight that made his heart stand
still with horror, while an almost superhuman effort alone
prevented a sharp cry of agony escaping his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon a bed in the corner opposite him lay Editha Dalton.
She was as white as the counterpane covering her, and
wasted to a mere skeleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was sobbing in a nervous, excited way, her thin white
hands clasped upon her heaving breast, her eyes wild and
staring, and fixed in a fascinated gaze upon a burly, repulsive-looking
man, who stood by the bedside scowling fiercely
upon her.</p>

<p class='c007'>By his side there also stood a nicely dressed, rather prepossessing
woman of about fifty-five.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their backs were toward the door where Earle was stationed,
consequently they had seen nothing of the almost
noiseless movement of that transom behind them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It took all the force of Earle’s will to control his intense
excitement as he looked upon the scene just described.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never in his life had he felt so dizzy and faint as he did
at that moment, while a weakening, sickening tremor pervaded
every nerve in his body.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better let her alone now, Tom, and don’t come here
again for a week. Let her get a little strength before you
exert your power over her again,” the woman said in reply
to the man’s last observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The weaker she is the less will she will have,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her will is so strong that you will never move her to
tell what you want to know; and you do not want to kill
her, I know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he admitted, with a scowl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She will do almost anything you tell her, except to reveal
what will injure that one person; that seems to be an instinct
which nothing can conquer, and your magnetic force
is not sufficient to overcome it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not need to tell me that,” he growled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I want you to let her alone for awhile; <em>I</em> don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>want her dying on <em>my</em> hands,” returned the woman, with
decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ill-looking man did not reply, but made a few passes
over Editha’s head and face, touching her on the forehead
and in the region of the epigastrium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost instantly the wild look faded from her eyes, her
clasped hands dropped apart, and fell limp and nerveless
upon the counterpane, while she lay panting and exhausted,
but looking much more natural to Earle than she had done
a moment before with that strained look on her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman came forward, gently raised her head, and
held a bowl to her lips, from which she drank eagerly, and
seemed much refreshed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more the villain turned toward her, and said, with
sullen ferocity:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my plucky fine lady, how much longer do you suppose
you can stand this kind of thing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha made no reply, but her eyes, which seemed unnaturally
large, now that she was so thin, gleamed defiance
at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are getting weaker every day, and you’re getting so
pale and poor that that fine young chap you’re so fond of
would not know you if he should see you now,” he continued,
heartlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>A look of inexpressible sadness settled upon the fair face,
the white lids quivered a moment and then drooped over
the blue eyes, and the pale lips trembled painfully; but she
made no other sign of her suffering, uttered no word to his
cruel taunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her silence exasperated him, and, leaning down so that
his face came almost on a level with hers, he hissed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <em>shall</em> tell me where that paper is, or you shall never
see the outside of these walls again. Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will <em>never</em> tell you,” she now said, in a weak voice,
but with a firmness that made another fierce oath leap to his
lips, and sent a shudder through her slight frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle ground his teeth, but waited to hear no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>He noiselessly descended from his perch, dressed himself
with all possible dispatch, all excepting his boots; then quietly
unlocking his door, opened it a crack, and stood there in the
dark waiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>His mind was made up to do a bold thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>His weariness and illness were all forgotten; his nerves
were steady and quiet, and the strength of a Samson seemed
quivering in every muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>He waited perhaps fifteen minutes, when he heard the key
turn in the door of the room on his right.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another moment and the wretch whom he had seen there
came forth and took a preliminary survey of the hall before
proceeding further.</p>

<p class='c007'>How he expected to get out of the hotel at that hour of
the night without being discovered, particularly when he had
three flights of stairs and as many halls to traverse, was a
point Earle did not allow himself time to consider.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man, apparently satisfied that there was nothing to
impede his progress, glided velvet-shod over the soft carpet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle allowed him to get well past his door, then, stealing
out without a sound, he crept up behind him and hit out
square from his shoulder a tremendous blow, which taking
his prey just behind the ear, doubled him up in an instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>He caught him in his arms before he could fall to the floor,
for he had no desire to make any disturbance at that hour
of the night, and then by main strength half carried, half
dragged him back into the room he had occupied, laid him
upon the floor, and locked him in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a sleeper had been aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blow he had dealt was quick and powerful, but not
loud enough to awaken any one from a sound slumber,
though it had rendered his victim unconscious for the time,
and the noise of dragging him the short distance to his room
had not disturbed any one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next thing was to get inside that other room without
creating any confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew that his captive was only stunned, and would
doubtless soon recover from the effects of the blow he had
given him; but locked within that room, he knew he could
not escape for he was in the fourth story, and could not,
of course, make his way out by the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not think, either, that he would make any noise
upon returning to his senses, for he would be sure to bring
upon himself deeper trouble if he did so.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood and listened a moment or two outside the door
of the room where Editha lay, thinking that something of the
disturbance must have reached its occupants, since both were
awake, and the affair had occurred so near to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He hoped the attendant would come to the door and look
out to see what was the trouble, when he would easily be able
to get inside, and into Editha’s presence, without using any
forcible means.</p>

<p class='c007'>If her attendant had not been attracted, and she did not
come, he had resolved to knock gently for admittance. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>then he feared he should not gain it, since he surmised, and
correctly, too, that the man must have some signal by which
his presence could be known from that of any one else.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s conjectures, however, proved correct. Editha’s
attendant had heard a slight noise in the hall and been
startled by it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you hear anything?” she asked, turning to the girl
on the bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, nothing,” she answered, wearily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something has happened, I fear,” she said to herself,
and then going to the door, bent her head to listen, an expression
of great anxiety on her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could hear nothing, however; but apparently not quite
satisfied, she ventured to unlock the door and peer forth into
the hall. This was Earle Wayne’s opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>With noiseless tread he stepped quickly up to her, and,
before she was hardly aware of his intention, pushed the
door open, forced her back into the room, and entered himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another instant and the door was again shut, locked, and
the key in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>His next movement was to see if the door leading into
that other room was locked also.</p>

<p class='c007'>It proved to be, but the key was in the lock, and he pocketed
this, too, thus gaining all the power he wanted for the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole transaction had not occupied above six or seven
minutes, nor had a word been spoken; but Earle had done a
good thing, for in that time he had captured single-handed,
one of the most successful robbers in the United States, as
well as his accomplice, and doubtless had saved the girl he
loved from even greater sufferings than she had already
experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this accomplished, and both keys in his pocket, he
now turned his attention to the occupant of the bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Editha had fainted dead away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX<br> <span class='large'>THE MISSING PAPER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“How dare you enter this room at such an hour?” demanded
the woman in attendance, who, after the first shock
had passed, quickly recovered herself and was now prepared
to do battle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“We will have no words upon the subject just now, if you
please—it is one that will keep, for awhile, at least; get restoratives
and revive this fainting girl without delay,” Earle
commanded, in quiet though stern tones, and then bent anxiously
over his unconscious loved one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman, cowed by his authoritative manner, proceeded
to attend Editha at once, although it was with a face nearly
as white as the waxen one upon the pillow. With a sinking
heart Earle stood by jealously watching her every movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, his darling, his promised wife, lay there looking
more like a beautiful piece of sculpture than like a human
being who would ever breathe or speak again, and a great
fear took possession of him that she never would recover.
But the woman was evidently a good nurse, and, under the
influence of the restoratives she was using, Editha soon gave
signs of returning life.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she at last opened her eyes, Earle was sitting by
her side, and smiled upon her as she looked at him, as if
it was the most natural thing in the world for him to be
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet he actually held his breath, fearing that the shock of
his presence might make her swoon again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle!” she breathed, a look of awe stealing over her
countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The look told him that for the moment she believed herself
dead, and to have met him in another world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my darling, Earle, and no one else,” he said, softly,
bending down and touching her forehead with his lips. That
caress brought her more to herself. A wave of gladness
swept over her face, her eyes lighted with a beautiful and
almost holy look of love, then, with a sigh that seemed
to throw off all its burdens and fear, every feature settled
into restfulness and peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am <em>so</em> glad!” was all she could say, and that in a voice
too weak for anything but a whisper.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could have bowed his head and wept over her to find
her thus, all her bright beauty faded, her strength nearly
spent, almost dying, he feared.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he knew he must control himself and minister to
her, if he would save her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you anything that will give her strength?” he asked,
turning to her attendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; there are wines and liquors in the cabinet, and
beef-tea warm upon the gas-stove in the bath-room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle had convinced himself with a glance before this that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>there was only one door to the bath-room, and he now commanded
her to bring some of the beef-tea.</p>

<p class='c007'>She brought it almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Taste it yourself first,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You need not fear for her—I have no desire to have
the life of <em>any</em> one to answer for,” she said scornfully,
and flushing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drink some of it,” he persisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would not trust her, and she swallowed a mouthful
unhesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then slipped his arm gently under Editha’s pillow, and
lifted her until she could lean comfortably against his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drink this now, dear, for my sake,” he said, putting the
bowl to her lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without a question she obeyed, drinking slowly until the
last drop had disappeared, and Earle’s heart began to grow
lighter.</p>

<p class='c007'>If she would do that often she would soon be better, he
thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will give you strength,” he said; “now lie down and
try to sleep. I shall not leave you again to-night, and when
you are refreshed I will let you talk with me a little.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He laid her gently back, stopping to kiss her almost hueless
lips as he did so.</p>

<p class='c007'>She put one hand up over the back of his neck and held
him a moment so, his face almost touching hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have saved me, Earle,” she said, feebly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust so, my injured darling,” he answered, with unsteady
voice, and then watched her while the tired eyes
closed; the wan face settled into peace, and she slept like a
weary child.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he turned his attention to the woman, who had
watched him with wondering eyes all the while.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pointing to a lounge on the opposite side of the room, he
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madam, if you are weary you can lie down there until
morning. I shall take charge of your patient henceforth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By what right?” she demanded, bridling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The right of her promised husband,” he answered, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman started violently, searched his face a moment,
her own growing very pale again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you——” she began, but her lips refused to complete
the sentence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is Earle Wayne. Doubtless you have heard it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>before, and now surmised as much,” he said, not pitying her
agitation in the least.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe it,” she at last said, in a low, angry tone,
while at the same time she steathily moved in the direction
of the bell-pull.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle marked the movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will please sit over there,” he said, quietly, and
pointing to the lounge. “I am not in need of any assistance
at present, and can summon it myself if I think it necessary.
It will be wiser for you to comply with my request,”
he added, sternly, as she hesitated. “If you make any disturbance,
I will have you lodged in a station-house in less
than half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman cowed at once at this, and retreated in sullen
silence to the lounge, where, settling herself comfortably, she
did not move again, while Earle for the next two hours kept
his vigil by Editha’s bedside, where she slept quietly, sweetly,
and refreshingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>While she is thus sleeping we will take a bird’s-eye view
of the time that had elapsed since her encounter with Tom
Drake, after leaving John Loker’s house, and from which
she was rescued by the sturdy policeman, only to fall into
still deeper trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that after she had taken tea with
her father she repaired to her own room, where she made
a careful copy of John Loker’s confession, and then hid the
original, with his signature attached, beneath the cushion
of her jewel-box. She then inclosed the copy in an envelope
addressed to Earle, and proceeded to write a long letter to
him, recounting her adventures of the evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her father had gone out immediately after supper, the
servants were all abed in their rooms, and she was entirely
alone in the front portion of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had taken her so long to make a copy of the confession
that she was not half through with her letter when the
cathedral clock near by struck the hour of eleven.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost simultaneously with its last stroke the door of her
room swung noiselessly open, and a fierce, ugly face, half
shaded by a slouch hat, appeared in the aperture. A moment
after the figure of a man entered, the door was softly
closed, and he advanced with a stealthy, cat-like tread to
where the young girl, who was deeply engaged in writing to
her lover, sat bending over her writing-desk. She was not
conscious of the presence of the intruder until, reaching for
a new pen, she chanced to raise her eyes, and saw him
standing close by her side.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>A cry of fright parted her lips as she instantly recognized
the repulsive features and burly form of Tom Drake. Without
giving her time to repeat her cry, he clapped his hand
over her mouth in the same way he had done earlier in the
evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, ha! my plucky jade, did you think I would tamely
give up the chase?” he asked, with a horrible leer. “Not
so, my pretty,” he continued; “there is altogether too much
at stake for that. But I can’t stand here to hold you—will
you promise to keep still if I’ll take my hand from your
mouth? You’d better, or I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped short, with a fierce look that frightened her
excessively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old man is out,” he went on, as she did not make
any sign of promise. “I’ve been watching around all the
evening—came directly here after I was obliged to leave
you so abruptly—ha, ha! and I saw him make for the theater;
he probably won’t be home for an hour or two yet, as
I have invited one of my friends to give him a little outside
entertainment on the way. The servants all went to bed
more than an hour ago, and you are completely in my power.
Now, once for all, will you be reasonable, and promise not
to make a fuss?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha saw that there was no way but to yield, and a feeling
of thankfulness stole over her, despite her terror at finding
herself again in the wretch’s power, that she had concealed
John Loker’s confession early in the evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>She signified her assent to the villain’s terms by a motion
of her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Honor bright?” he asked, adding, fiercely: “I’ll choke you
instanter if you attempt to make any disturbance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She nodded again, and he at once released his hold of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, little Miss Pluck,” he resumed, “what have you done
with that paper I asked you for once before? I want it, and
<em>I’m going to have it</em>. Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha did hear, and the lines about her small mouth settled
into an expression of unyielding firmness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t mean to give it to me, hey?” he demanded,
reading aright her look.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was too weak and excited from fright to speak, but
she shook her head resolutely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I tell you I’m <em>going</em> to have it, my lady, or it’ll be
the worse for <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A bright thought darted into her mind, and she immediately
acted upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I will give you the paper, will you go away at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>as quietly as you came, and leave me and everything in
the house unmolested?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the talk—now you’re sensible,” the ruffian returned,
in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you promise?” she persisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I’ll go instanter. You see it’s very important for
my future career that the little document doesn’t get into
circulation; so hand it over, and I’ll be off as quiet and quick
as a mouse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha drew from the envelope she had addressed to Earle
the copy she had made, and passed it to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached out and took the envelope from her, and
read the name written upon the back before looking at the
paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, ho! you were going to send it right to headquarters,
were you?—and I was just in the nick of time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chuckling to himself, he unfolded the paper she had given
him and began to read.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contents seemed to amuse him immensely, for he continued
to chuckle and laugh to himself all the way through;
but his face grew stern and threatening as he reached the
end, and Editha’s heart failed her when he said, fiercely:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This won’t do, miss; this is only a copy, and I want the
original. Hand it over quick. Did you think I would be so
readily cheated?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know it is a copy?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had written that also with a pencil, as she could write
more rapidly, and she had thought perhaps he would think it
was the one she had written in John Loker’s house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I saw John Loker sign the other,” he said, with
a malignant scowl, adding: “Now, will you hand the other
over to me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, I will not,” was the firm reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>He seemed staggered for a moment at this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won’t?” he repeated, at length, with an oath, and
fixing his eyes upon her in a way that made her catch her
breath and feel as if her strength was forsaking her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know,” he added, “that you are in the power of
a desperate man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I suppose so; but that paper is of more importance
to me than any other possession in the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, ha! is that the way the wind blows? <em>He’s</em> a lover,
eh?” laughed the villain, coarsely, and with a leer that made
the blood boil in the young girl’s veins and glow hotly in
her cheeks. “Allow me to ask,” he continued, with a sinister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>gleam in his eye, “if it is more precious to you than your—<em>life</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shrank from him in sudden terror at the question, but,
after a moment’s thought, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“N-o, I cannot say that it is; but I do not think you would
quite dare to <em>murder</em> me to get it. At all events <em>I shall not
give it to you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked at her with something akin to admiration on
his face; he evidently had not expected to find her so resolute,
but at the same time her obstinacy angered him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think I would not <em>dare</em> to put you out of the way?”
he repeated, savagely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What good would it do you? You surely would not accomplish
your object then,” Editha strove to say, dauntlessly,
but feeling inwardly very weak and trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw the force of her argument and swore again, and,
turning to her writing-desk, began turning over its contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, he did not find what he sought there, and then
commenced a general search of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bureau drawers, boxes, and every other receptacle that
she had were overturned and thoroughly searched.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her closets also were ransacked, and the pockets of every
dress turned wrong side out, but with the same result.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her jewel-casket stood on her dressing-case open, with
all her jewelry nicely arranged on its velvet cushion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha’s heart stood still as she saw him approach this,
but she did not move or give a sign of the great fear that
oppressed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stooped and looked at the pretty things there, took up
one or two and examined them more closely, then laid them
back again in their place, and turned his attention to something
else.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mighty burden rolled from the fair girl’s heart as this
danger was passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had expected he would put every article in his pocket,
and then perhaps turn the box upside down to seek for more;
but evidently he did not care for plunder to-night. At last
he came and stood before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have searched everywhere. It must be upon your person,”
he said, with a desperate gleam in his eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>She started from him with a look of terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I swear to you that it is not anywhere about me,” she
said. “As soon as I made a copy of it I went and hid it,
though I could not then have told what made me do it. Now
I know,” she added, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>He saw that she was speaking only truth, and in great perplexity
he sat down to think.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it in this room?” he asked, at length.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not tell you,” Editha answered, her courage beginning
to rise as he became discouraged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it in this house?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not tell you,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re a—plucky piece,” he muttered between his teeth,
and fixing his fierce eyes again upon her in the strange way
she had noticed before.</p>

<p class='c007'>They seemed to transfix her, and a shuddering sensation
pervaded her frame whenever she met them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean to brave me and risk the consequences?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you ever gain that paper it will be through your own
efforts alone. I shall never <em>tell</em> you where it is,” she replied,
slowly and firmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He acted for a moment as if undecided what to do next.
Then he took up the letter she had been writing Earle and
read it through.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could not help this, of course, but her cheeks burned
and her eyes flashed indignantly as she thought of the tender
little passages that she had thrown in now and then, and that
had been intended for her lover’s eye alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had told him a good deal of her adventure, and how
that, as soon as she had copied it, she had hidden the precious
original; but strangely enough she never mentioned even to
him <em>where</em>, but said that no one but herself knew of its
hiding-place, and to-morrow she intended taking it to Mr.
Felton to see what he advised about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha!” said the wretch, as he read this; “no one knows
anything about the precious document but yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to-morrow you were intending to tell some one else
about it,” he said, rattling the letter he held in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you are sure <em>nothing</em> will make you give it to <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then there is but one thing left for me to do,” he muttered,
striding angrily toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He seized both her hands in his, and again fixed his cruel
eye upon hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>For one moment she looked defiance at him, though she
was so frightened by his manner that she had no power to
cry out, nor make any effort to release herself from his hold;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the next her expression changed, and her eyes began to
droop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Look at me!</em>” he commanded, bending nearer to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She obeyed, and gazed into his face as if suddenly fascinated.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment he held her glance, while she felt as if all
her will-power was forsaking her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made a few passes over her head and face, touched
her upon the pit of the stomach, and she instantly became
like a reed in his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had mesmerized her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX<br> <span class='large'>FLOWN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, the strange man had mesmerized Editha Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>He possessed that peculiar power, or magnetic influence,
something of which almost every one has either seen or
heard, and which should never be exercised except in the
most judicious manner, and governed by unquestionable principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>To all appearances Editha was completely in his power, but
whether it was strong enough to make her comply with his
every command or not yet remained to be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have all learned something of the young girl’s strength
of will, in her resolute adherence to the right and her persistent
opposition to everything wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether this was all instinct rooted and grounded in her
nature, and strengthened for years by conscientious cultivation,
which would in a measure protect her and prevent her
from becoming his abject slave, could not yet be determined.
But he immediately proceeded to test his power.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pick up and bring me that paper,” he commanded, pointing
to the copy of John Loker’s confession, which had
fallen upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>She stooped obediently and handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring me your watch and chain,” was the next mandate.</p>

<p class='c007'>She hesitated a moment. It had been a gift from Richard
Forrester, was very valuable, and she prized it above all
her other trinkets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring it,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>She went to do his bidding, and gave it to him without
a murmur.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he did not care for it, it seemed, as he laid it down
upon her writing-desk and left it there untouched.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Now give me that ring from your finger,” he said, pointing
to the beautiful pearl that Earle had placed upon her
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>She involuntarily clasped her hands tightly together, and
stood staring helplessly at him without obeying him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take it off,” he repeated, more sternly; but she did not
move.</p>

<p class='c007'>He muttered a curse, and then bade her go bring the contents
of her jewel-box.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantly she turned to do his bidding, carefully gathered
up every article and brought them to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he commanded her to take them back and arrange
them as they belonged.</p>

<p class='c007'>She unhesitatingly obeyed, quickly arranging everything
in its place, and giving no sign of the precious treasure concealed
beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she went and stood humbly before him again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now go and get that paper signed by John Loker and
bring it to me,” he said, bending all the power of his will
to influence her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took one step forward, her eyelids quivered, her nostrils
dilated, her bosom heaved; then she stopped, staring
helplessly at him, while her hands were again locked in
a nervous clasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Strange!” he muttered, with a frown.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then issued several other commands, which she obediently
executed, and at last he told her once more to bring
that paper, but with the same result as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would not do it. Her love for Earle, and her determination
not to yield anything connected with him, seemed
to be an instinct stronger than his power over her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again and again he tried to gain his point, but without
avail, and, with a perplexed and angry look, he muttered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It won’t do—my power is not strong enough yet—it will
take time; but she says no one knows where the paper is
but herself, so <em>I will take care of her</em>. She has hid what
I want, and now I’ll hide her. It will be risky business, but
there is no other way; if I go away and leave her, some
one else will have it to-morrow morning, and then the whole
world will know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He sat thinking the matter over for some little time, Editha
standing patiently by him, as if waiting to do his bidding still
further.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Put those things on,” he said, at last, and pointing to
a hat and waterproof that had been thrown upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>She immediately put them on.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Now get a vail and tie over your face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With the humility of a servant she obeyed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then went to the door and looked out.</p>

<p class='c007'>All was still.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gas in both halls had been partially turned off, and
now burned dimly, and nothing was moving in all that great
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stepped back into the room, took Editha by the arm,
and said, roughly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are to go with me—see that you make no noise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then led her out, down the broad stairway, through
the lower hall, to the outer door.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a moment more they were in the street, and he hurried
her from the place as fast as she was able to walk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaching a corner several blocks away, he stopped by a
carriage which seemed to be waiting there.</p>

<p class='c007'>This he bade Editha enter, then following her, gathered
up the reins and drove rapidly away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very early the next morning a very respectable appearing
lady and her invalid daughter, the latter much wrapped
to shield her from the weather, arrived at the quiet hotel
before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had come from a distant part of the State—had been
traveling all night, madam said, in order that the sick girl
might avail herself of the skill of a noted physician residing
in the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>They took rooms in the upper story of the hotel; it was
not so full usually, and more quiet; besides, madam hinted,
her daughter was sometimes not quite herself, and they preferred
being where they could not disturb others.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took a whole suite, as her son would occasionally
visit them, and be obliged to remain over night.</p>

<p class='c007'>And thus Editha Dalton was spirited away from her home
and hidden away in the very heart of her own city, and there
she remained for several weeks until found so strangely by
Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once established there, paying regularly for their accommodations,
and giving no trouble, they were regarded as
very quiet and respectable boarders, seldom going out except
when the young lady was able to ride, closely wrapped,
and vailed, and magnetized, and always in a closed carriage,
always taking their meals in their own room, as the invalid
was “unable to go to the public table,” and madam was
“unwilling to leave her poor, dear child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once in awhile a servant or the clerk, in passing through
the upper hall late at night, thought they heard a low sobbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and moaning in their rooms, but they had been told
something of the invalid’s infirmity, and so gave themselves
no uneasiness upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so right there in the very midst of the great city,
with the detectives at work all about them, and the excitement
that the deep mystery was creating, this great wrong
was being perpetrated; and had it not been for Earle
Wayne’s strange whim to change his hotel upon that particular
night, when the house was so full, and madam’s “son”
absent, the story of Editha’s remarkable disappearance and
rescue would never have been related.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>When Editha awoke, after two hours of undisturbed refreshing
sleep, she found Earle still sitting beside her, and
her former attendant, with her face buried in her hands, sitting
in sullen silence upon the lounge opposite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <em>did</em> not dream it, then?” she said, looking up into her
lover’s face with a long-drawn, trembling sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my darling; you have slept too soundly to dream of
anything. Are you rested?” he asked, bending down to kiss
the sweet quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but, oh! Earle, don’t let <em>him</em> come back again,” she
pleaded, with a shudder, as she reached out her thin hand
and grasped his with nervous strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bent his lips to her ear, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my own; he is safely locked within the next room,
and he can never hurt you again. Bring some more of that
drink,” he added, addressing the woman opposite.</p>

<p class='c007'>She arose and obeyed, and Editha drank as eagerly as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Could you eat something?” he asked, regarding with a
thrill of pain the thin hands that held the bowl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not now, Earle; I will wait and take breakfast with
you by and by,” she answered, with a bright, hopeful look
into his anxious face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are feeling better already?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she returned, with a ripple of happy laughter.
“You know ‘a merry heart doeth good like a medicine,’ and I
feel very happy and <em>safe</em> just now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, she did not look like the same person that Earle
had seen through the transom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes were now bright and hopeful, and her face shining
with happiness and content.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will let me talk now? I cannot sleep any more,” she
said, as she settled back upon the pillow which he arranged
for her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“If you are able, a little. I do not wish you to get too
weary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to tell you how I happen to be here—at least, all
that I know about it myself—and I have <em>such</em> good news
for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then let it be in just as few words as possible, or the
excitement will be too much for you,” he replied, feeling
greatly relieved to see her looking so much brighter, and
to hear her speak in her natural tone once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>She began by relating her visit to the Loker’s family, and
the confession of John Loker, her adventure with the ruffian
upon the street, her escape, and his subsequent entrance
to her room during the same night.</p>

<p class='c007'>His face grew grave and troubled as she told him how
persistently she had refused to reveal the hiding-place of
the precious paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling, you ran a terrible risk; he might have taken
your life,” he said, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it was the only proof of <em>your honor</em>; it alone would
give you back the respect and esteem of men, and I <em>would
not</em> give it to him,” she said, with a sparkle of the old defiance
in her eye, then continued: “I did not think he would
quite dare do me any personal violence, and I was willing to
suffer a great deal rather than lose anything so precious.
I do not seem to remember much of what happened after he
seized my hands and looked at me in that dreadful way; only
it seemed at times, when he spoke to me, as if some force
within me was trying to part soul and body—until I found
myself here with this strange woman. I was left quietly with
her for two or three days, when he came again and tried
to frighten me into telling him what he wanted to know. I
always refused until he lost his patience and temper, when
he would dart toward me, seize my hands, look into my eyes,
and almost instantly everything would be a blank to me, and
when I came to myself again I would be so exhausted and ill
I could not rise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The villain mesmerized you,” Earle said, with a white,
stern face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that was the only explanation that I could think
of to account for his peculiar power over me. He has told
me almost every time he came that he would allow me to
go home if I would tell him my secret; but, of course, I would
not do that when I was myself, and, from the fact of his
continuing to exercise his influence, I suppose I am just as
wilful when under his magnetic control regarding that one
thing. Earle,” she concluded, slipping her hand confidingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>into his, “you have given me a blessed release. I do not believe
I could have borne it very much longer, for I have
been growing very weak of late; but my prayer night and
day has been that I might be spared to you, and that God
would not allow him to wring my precious secret from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did I find him torturing you with such strange questions
about your name and parentage to-night?” Earle asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha shook her head with a sad smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He almost always came in the night; I suppose there was
less danger of his being discovered then; but as for his
questions and my answers, I know no more about them than
you could have done during all these weeks. Everything became
a blank as soon as he touched me and looked at me
in a certain way, and I do not know, what I have done or
said; I only know that I have suffered horribly sometimes;”
and a trembling seized her at the remembrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woman, what have you to say regarding this strange
story?” Earle demanded, turning to the attendant, who had
sat motionless during Editha’s narrative.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have nothing to say,” she returned, lifting a defiant face
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be better for you to show a friendly disposition,”
Earle returned, quietly. “I have this villain of whom
Miss Dalton speaks securely locked up and ready for the
officers as soon as morning breaks, and I will punish you to
the extent of the law, also, unless you show a disposition to
do what is right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then related how he happened to be there that night—how
he had searched for her so wearily, until he felt that
he must have rest, and coming there, and hearing her sobbing,
he had been strangely impressed that something was
wrong, and had proceeded to investigate the matter. He told
how he had attacked Tom Drake in the hall, dragged and
locked him within his own room, and then resolved to enter
hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman appeared greatly disturbed as she listened
to this; she evidently had not supposed anything so serious
had happened to her partner, and it was a very pale face that
Earle looked into as he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was it not mesmeric power that the wretch used to try to
force Miss Dalton’s secret from her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; it can do no harm to tell that much,” she muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was the meaning of those very strange questions
he put to her to-night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She thought a moment, and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“It was necessary for Miss Dalton’s health that she should
go out at times and get the air; but we never took her out
unless she was mesmerized, and Tom thought that if anything
happened to us at any time, and she should be questioned,
if she answered as he taught her, no one would suspect or
molest her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he in the habit of exercising his power over people
in this way in carrying on his nefarious business?” Earle demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman would not reply, and Editha said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether he has ever carried it so far with any one else
is doubtful; but I heard him say once, when they both
thought I was asleep, that unless something turned up pretty
soon he would be obliged to go to lecturing again, and showing
off in the old way, which I took to mean that he had
once lectured upon the subject of mesmerism, and tried his
experiments upon the public.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The wretch! He will have an opportunity to practice
something else, and show off in a different way before long,
I’m thinking,” Earle answered, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day was beginning to break, and the occupants of the
house were arousing from their slumbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling,” Earle said to Editha, “you must have a
larger and more airy room than this immediately;” and he
arose and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, you will not leave me?” she said, the frightened
look returning to her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I shall only go to the door to speak with the waiter;
and you,” turning to her attendant, “will please assist Miss
Dalton to dress meanwhile, so that she can be moved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The waiter soon knocked at the door, and Earle stepped
just outside to converse with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He told him something of what had happened during the
night, and the man expressed no little surprise at what he
heard, and that the long lost Miss Dalton had been concealed
in that house. He then asked him if it would be possible for
him to give Miss Dalton a better room, and he replied that
some of the guests had already departed on an early train,
and he should have a first-class room at his disposal in fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>A half-hour later Editha was borne into a beautiful apartment,
where not long after she and Earle breakfasted together,
a heavy burden lifted from both their hearts, while
the former, happy in the presence of her lover, seemed to
grow brighter, stronger, and more like herself every moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>At eight o’clock Earle bethought himself of his prisoner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>he having locked the woman into the room as soon as Editha
had been removed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I have attended to that matter,” he said, drawing
her tenderly to him and kissing her now smiling lips,
“I will telegraph immediately to Mr. Dalton; and, darling,
when he comes I have some joyful news to tell you both. I
do not fear that he will oppose any obstacles to our marriage
now. I trust all our troubles are over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alas! they could not know that they were standing upon
the brink of even a more fearful precipice—about to be
plunged into a deeper abyss of grief and trouble than either
had yet known. Earle went out for an officer to arrest his
prisoners, and, soon returning, proceeded to the rooms where
he had left them, as he thought, so secure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both doors were open! Both birds had flown!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXI<br> <span class='large'>A STORMY INTERVIEW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The consternation that Earle and the officers experienced
when they discovered that both Tom Drake and his accomplice
had escaped, can be better imagined than described.
But there was no help for it; the former had undoubtedly
had burglars’ instruments in his possession, and while Editha
was being removed and attended to, had picked the lock upon
the door where he was confined, and then released his companion
in mischief and fled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The news that Miss Dalton was at last found, with many
of the circumstances attending her discovery, spread like
wild-fire, and soon brought numerous friends and acquaintances
to see and congratulate her upon the happy event.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Felton was among the first, and the old gentleman
appeared as rejoiced to see her as if she had been his own
child, and was enthusiastic in his praises of her courage and
bravery in refusing to give up the precious document that
could alone restore Earle his honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton was immediately telegraphed to, and three days
later he, also, made his appearance in her room at the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had improved very rapidly during those three days,
and though she was still exceedingly weak and nervous, starting
at the lightest noise, the wild light returning to her eyes,
yet the color was beginning to return to her cheeks and lips,
the music to her voice, and the old look of brightness to her
face.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Mr. Dalton greeted Editha with some show of fondness,
but he appeared anything but pleased when he heard of
Earle’s return, and that it was through his instrumentality
that she obtained her release, and almost immediately his
manner began to assume its former coolness toward her.
But Miss Dalton was not a daughter to be slighted by any
means, when she had such a snug fortune of her own; and
it now began to be whispered quite generally that Mr. Dalton
had been exceedingly unfortunate in some of his speculations,
and that it was a very fine thing that he could have her income
to fall back upon during this rainy day.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was not exactly uncivil or aggressive in his treatment
of Earle, yet he testified his displeasure at his presence
by sullen looks, sarcasm and sneers, until Earle more than
once lost patience, and would have had it out with him had
he not feared that any trouble would be serious injury to
Editha in her weak state.</p>

<p class='c007'>But although he was very forbearing and always courteous,
yet he never seemed to gain any ground with his
enemy, and at last resolved to bring matters to a crisis.</p>

<p class='c007'>He called upon Mr. Dalton one morning at his own room,
and formally proposed for Editha’s hand in marriage. Of
course he had anticipated a refusal, and of course he got it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think, Mr. Dalton,” he said, not at all disconcerted,
“that if you will listen while I explain to you something
of the change that has occurred in my prospects during the
last few months, you will not only be willing to waive all
your objections, but give us both your blessing, instead of so
curt a refusal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton sneered visibly at this; indeed his face was
gradually acquiring a habitual sneer, as if things generally
were disturbing his tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahem! Mr. Wayne, permit me to say that no change,
<em>of whatever nature</em>, in your prospects would affect my decision.
You cannot marry Miss Dalton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, sir, remember that no stain rests upon my name now.
I am free from every taint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed! I am glad that <em>you</em> are so happy as to think
so,” he returned, satirically.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle flushed, but, controlling his indignation, he returned:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I not only think so, but all the world will be obliged to
acknowledge it very soon, as I have already taken measures
to have John Loker’s confession made public.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the world may think does not concern me at all;
you will please consider my answer as final and unalterable;”
and he waived his hand as if to dismiss the subject entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Again the hot blood rushed to Earle’s very forehead, and
it was all he could do not to let his temper fly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you please to give me some reason for what seems
to me an unreasonable refusal?” he asked, quietly; then,
after an instant’s thought, he added. “I have lately fallen
heir to quite a handsome property, and can place Miss Dalton
in a position befitting her worth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I regret, for your sake, that I am unable to confer the
favor requested upon one <em>so noble</em> and heir to such <em>brilliant</em>
prospects; but even were it possible, allow me to ask what
<em>name</em> you could bestow upon Miss Dalton?” and the look
accompanying this question was so cunning and full of malice
that for a moment Earle was startled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The woman I wed will never have cause to blush for the
name she bears, sir,” he replied, with an indignant flush,
and wondering if it was possible that Mr. Dalton could know
aught concerning his previous history.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, indeed!” was the sarcastic reply. “I trust—I hope
truly that you may find one <em>worthy to bear it</em>. Miss Dalton
cannot. I decline that honor for her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Dalton is of age, I believe, sir,” Earle said, very
quietly, but the words were rather ominous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Dalton is about twenty-two, Mr.—ah—<em>Wayne</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Why was it, Earle wondered, that Mr. Dalton almost always
addressed him in this peculiar way now, with a pause,
an interjection, and that strange emphasis on his last name?</p>

<p class='c007'>But he replied to his last remark with a dignity that became
him well:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, sir, we will leave the question for her to decide,
and abide by her verdict. I desired to render you all due
courtesy, but, of course, you are as well aware as I that
my seeking your approval was a mere matter of form. Good-morning,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-morning,” Mr. Dalton returned, with a mocking
bow, and saw him depart with a sinister smile and an almost
fiendish chuckle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle immediately sought Editha, and communicated the
result of the interview to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not ask you to run away with me, my darling,”
he said, with a fond smile, “for I must marry my wife in
an honorable way. Neither shall I use any arguments to
try to persuade you to defy your father and marry me openly.
I shall leave it entirely with you. It must be just as your
own heart dictates. Editha, you must decide this matter for
yourself and me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Earle, it is hard,” she said; “my heart tells me that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>I belong to you, while a feeling of pity and affection prompts
me to consider, as far as is right, the feelings and wishes
of my father. I cannot understand him; he is so changed
since mamma and Uncle Richard died, I sometimes fear that
his mind is affected.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle thought that his mind was affected decidedly, being
possessed with an evil spirit of some kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An impassable barrier seems to have arisen between us,”
Editha continued, sadly; “and he has taken such an unaccountable
dislike to you that it seems very strange to me.
Let me think it all over for one night, Earle. Come to me to-morrow
at this time and you shall have my answer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle complied with her request and left her, feeling sad
and depressed himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew that he ought to return immediately to Wycliffe.
He had been gone a long time now, and was trespassing more
than he liked upon Mr. Tressalia’s good nature; but he did
not feel as if he could even think of such a thing as returning
and leaving Editha behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more he considered the matter the more inexplicable
Mr. Dalton’s fierce spite against him appeared. It seemed
so almost childishly unreasonable that he would not even
listen while he told him of his prospects. He seemed to
talk as if he was aware of something very shameful and
degrading connected with him, and yet he could not understand
how Mr. Dalton, here in America, could possibly know
aught of his previous history, or the shadow of shame that
had hung over his early life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, too, his declaring that “<em>no change of whatever nature</em>”
in his prospects could affect his answer seemed to imply
some deep and bitter personal hatred that, not being conscious
of ever having done him an injury, he could not
fathom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It surely could not be,” he thought, “because Richard
Forrester had so kindly remembered him at the time of his
death, and it was a petty feeling of jealousy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not touched the money which Editha had so nobly
insisted upon investing for him. It still lay accumulating in
the bank, and would remain there until the end of time for
any use that he would make of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so, after perplexing his brain over the matter, only
to become more deeply puzzled, he resolved to let it drop,
hoping that everything would come out right in the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding Mr. Dalton’s sarcastic and almost insulting
language and manner to him, Earle did not cherish
the least feeling of ill-will toward him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>At the time a feeling of indignation and impatience at
his injustice would momentarily arouse his hot blood, but
this soon passed, and he sincerely pitied him for being the
slave of such unholy passions as he manifested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning, feeling very uneasy and apprehensive
of he knew not what, he called, as Editha had desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could not shake off the feeling that he was about to
meet some dreadful impending fate; it seemed almost as
if a voiceless, wordless warning was impressing him, and
he found himself involuntarily repeating the words of one
who said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Often do the spirits</div>
      <div class='line'>Of great events stride on before the events,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in to-day already walks to-morrow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He found Editha calm, but looking weary and very sad,
as if the struggle of deciding had been too much for her
strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>She came and went toward him, looking so pale that she
seemed more like some beautiful spirit about to fade from
his sight than a woman whom he longed to call “wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have decided, Earle,” she said, the tears shining in her
eyes as she held out both hands to him in greeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took them and drew her toward him, searching her fair
face with his anxious eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling!” he said, in low, intense pleading tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going with <em>you</em>,” she whispered; and his arms instantly
encircled her, a low-spoken thanksgiving and blessing
falling from his lips, the burden rolling from his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa is already so estranged from me,” she continued,
“that I know I should be miserable to let you go back alone;
you would be very unhappy also.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The closer clasp of the arms infolding her confirmed the
truth of her statements, and told her how very dear she was
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The golden head drooped and rested trustfully against his
shoulder, and she went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps, when he sees how determined I am, he may
relent and consent to go with us. At all events, I feel that
I have no right to ruin both our lives, and yield to an
unreasonable command of his.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Earle could reply, Mr. Dalton himself entered
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! quite an affecting tableau,” he said, with a disagreeable
sneer; “it seems to be my privilege to—to have
the benefit of these interesting scenes.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>His eyes glittered with anger as they rested upon Earle,
but he continued, speaking to Editha:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must beg pardon for the intrusion; I merely came
to say that I want you to be ready to go to Newport next
week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha flushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had never spoken quite so peremptorily to her
before; he had been more willing to consult her convenience
and pleasure, more especially since he had in a
measure been dependent upon her income to supply his
own wants.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had seen, too, the look of malignant hatred which
he had cast upon Earle, and her spirit arose in rebellion
against it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had quietly withdrawn from her lover’s embrace
when the door opened, but remained standing by his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, I—I am not going to Newport this summer,”
she said, with outward calmness; but Earle could almost
feel her tremble, and his heart ached for her, in prospect
of the conflict which he knew must come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not going to Newport!” Mr. Dalton said, with raised
eyebrows and well-feigned surprise. “Who ever heard of
such a thing as our not going to Newport during the summer?
Of course you are going to Newport, Editha; I
could not think of leaving you at home alone, and—I
should be so exceedingly lonesome;” and he shot a cunning
glance at the young couple, that disagreeable sneer
still upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, I am really sorry if you will be lonely——” began
Editha, a tremble in her voice, when Earle quietly
laid his hand upon hers and stopped her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton,” he said, in a cold, business-like tone,
“we may as well come to the point and have this matter
settled once for all. Editha has already decided to return
with me to Europe as my wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of a blaze of anger, as he had expected, Mr.
Dalton chuckled audibly, and gleefully rubbed his hands
together, as if this were really a delightful piece of news
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he took no more notice of Earle than if he had
not been there. Instead, he again addressed himself to
Editha:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, did I understand that last statement of
Mr.—ah—<em>Wayne’s</em> correctly?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did, papa,” she answered, but it was a great effort
for her to utter the three short words.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“You have decided to spend your future in Europe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She ventured to glance at him. She could understand
neither his tone nor his mood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will leave your native land and go with a stranger
to a foreign country?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle is no stranger, papa,” she said, quickly; “we
have known him for years, and surely you ought to be
willing to trust me with one so good and true as he is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So good and true!” he repeated, mockingly. “You
are exceedingly fond of Mr. Wayne?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, I <em>am</em>,” Editha now said, boldly, and turning
her flashing eyes full upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her indignation was rising—her patience giving out
under his scathing sarcasms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Wayne ought to be a happy man—he doubtless
<em>is</em> a happy man in having so brave and fair a champion.
It is so beautiful to witness such entire trust and confidence—such
fervent affection. My dear, you can go to
Europe with Mr. Wayne if you choose, I suppose, seeing
that you have attained your majority, as he has once
hinted to me, but—<em>you cannot as his wife</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole sentence was spoken with great apparent
calmness and deliberation, but his eyes glowed like a
burning flame upon the lovers standing so proudly side by
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If my majority gives me the right to choose upon one
point, it does upon the other also, I suppose,” she returned,
coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, my dear, you are entirely mistaken there,”
returned Mr. Dalton, with aggravating affability, and darting
a fiery glance at Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, I do not understand you in this mood at all,”
Editha said, with some hauteur; “but I will say, once for
all, that I think you are exceedingly unkind, as well as
unreasonable. What possible objection can you have to
Earle in a moral point of view?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A gleam of malicious amusement flashed over his face
as he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must excuse me, Editha, but—really—I should
not presume to set myself up as a judge upon Mr.—ah—<em>Wayne’s</em>
morals—nor indeed upon the morals of any one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I do not consider that you have any right, for a
mere prejudice, to ruin both his life and mine—our united
happiness depends upon this union; and, papa, I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>marry Mr. Wayne—if not <em>with</em> your consent, then without
it,” she concluded, firmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, allow me to repeat, you <em>cannot</em> marry Mr.
Wayne.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And <em>I</em> repeat that I <em>shall</em> do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton chuckled again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. <em>Wayne</em> will, I suppose, be very <em>proud</em> to bestow
his <em>name</em> upon you,” he said, significantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Allow me to ask what you mean to insinuate by that
assertion?” Earle here interposed, flushing deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wayne is a name that one might well be proud of, if
one had a <em>right</em> to it,” he answered, maliciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you mean me to understand that you think I
have no right to it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have my doubts upon the matter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think I am an impostor—that I have been seeking
Miss Dalton’s affections under false pretentions—under
an assumed name?” Earle demanded, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <em>have</em> had some such idea; yes,” Mr. Dalton answered,
with a strange smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton, <em>what</em> do you mean? What do you really
know about me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton replied only by a low laugh, and Earle continued,
with some excitement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name <em>is</em> Earle Wayne—it is the name that my
mother gave to me upon my birth, and I will now
say——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Your mother!</em>” he interrupted, and a scornful, bitter
laugh rang out, making both his listeners shudder, it was
so fiendishly unnatural.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, why do you talk like this? <em>Why</em> are you so
prejudiced against Earle?” Editha burst forth, unable to
bear any more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘<em>Prejudice</em>’ is a <em>very mild term</em>, Editha,” he replied
with glittering eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What reason have you for hating him, then?” she
cried, passionately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have the very best reason in the world, according to
my judgment, for <em>hating not only him, but all that ever
belonged to him</em>,” Mr. Dalton answered, with deliberate
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir,” exclaimed Earle, in startled surprise, “<em>what</em> do
you know about me, or those belonging to me? and why
do you still persist in saying that Miss Dalton cannot be
my wife, when she has distinctly stated that she has
decided the matter? What possible barrier can there be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>to our union save the petty spite you so ignobly manifest
toward me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton laughed again at this—a low, mocking
laugh—and rubbed his hands in sardonic glee, while Earle
regarded him in amazed perplexity, and Editha wondered
if her father was not losing his mind that he should act
thus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does it surprise you, young man, that I appear to
have some knowledge of you? and shall I tell you, Editha
Dalton, why you can <em>never</em> become his wife?” he asked,
and Editha shivered and grew white at his ominous words.
“You know,” he continued, still addressing her, “that I
never tolerate or forgive opposition from any one—never
forgive either a fancied or a real wrong. Mine is a peculiar
temperament, I know, yet I am what I am, and those
who foil or oppose me must take the consequences. I
have never <em>loved</em> your devoted admirer, and since I have
discovered <em>his secret</em>——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Secret!” breathed both his listeners, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, <em>secret</em>. Had you no secret when you came to
Richard Forrester?” demanded Mr. Dalton of Earle, and
gnawing his lip savagely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I own that I had,” Earle answered, with a sigh;
“but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But a smooth tongue and lying lips will gloss almost
anything over,” his enemy interrupted, sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, you are fearfully unjust. Earle is the soul of
truth,” Editha cried, indignantly, adding: “What if he
had a secret?—he had a right to it, and no one should seek
to pry into it. At any rate, I do not believe it is anything
that affected his honor or nobility.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Editha,” Earle said, gracefully. “I <em>had</em>
a secret, but, thank Heaven, it need be a secret no longer;
and if you will both listen calmly, I will explain its nature
to you; I have only been waiting for a favorable opportunity
to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You hear, Editha?—he has a secret, and such a
secret! Shall I tell it? I think I can do so much more
effectively than he. He is a ——”</p>

<p class='c007'>We will not write the horrible word that sent every bit
of blood back upon Editha’s heart and made Earle speechless
from astonishment and indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was uttered with a venomous hatred such as few are
capable of either feeling or showing; and then, without waiting
to note the effect of his words, he went on, in wild and
excited tones:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Now, my fair champion of high-toned morality, is not that
a piece of news to make your ears tingle? You have dared
to oppose me time and again,” he continued, with a scowl
at her; “you have set aside my wishes and authority to favor
<em>him</em>, until I am determined that you shall suffer for it; and
your punishment, as well as his, will be no light one. Now,
what have you to say? Have I not advanced a good and sufficient
reason for your not marrying him, or shall I be obliged
to add another and stronger one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He glared upon the fair girl, his whole face working with
the passion that raged within him.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment she could not speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>She glanced from him to Earle, who stood very pale but
calm, and with a slight curl upon his handsome lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>For an instant he had been tempted to cast the lie in
the teeth of his foe, then he decided to await Editha’s reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had not been whiter on that night when he had found
her in the power of Tom Drake than she was at this moment,
and a weary, hunted look shone in her blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe it,” she said, drawing herself to her full
height; “but even if it were true, it is <em>not</em> a sufficient reason,
for the sin and shame are not his—they belong to a previous
generation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A wild, mocking laugh burst from Mr. Dalton’s lips at
this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such disinterested devotion it has never been my pleasure
to witness before,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s deep-drawn sigh of gratitude and thankfulness at
Editha’s reply had not been lost upon him, and it had seemed
to work him up to the highest pitch of excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton——” the young man began.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Hush!</em> will you? I’ll attend to you when I get through
with her,” he said, with a gesture of authority; “this girl has
got to learn that she cannot defy <em>me</em> with impunity. Now,
miss, as I’ve driven that nail home, hadn’t I better clinch it?
Shall I tell you yet more to convince you that you can never
marry this nameless vagabond?” and he bent toward her until
his evil face almost touched hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>She drew back from him with an involuntary expression of
disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she said, with a strangely sinking heart and shaking
voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you have anything more to tell me, please tell it <em>quick</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A ‘<em>good, and sufficient reason</em>’ I told you I had,” he returned,
very slowly and deliberately, and glancing from one
to the other to mark the effect of his words. “Yes, it is; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>I think you will both be obliged to acknowledge it when I
tell you that <em>Earle Wayne</em>, as he calls himself, <span class='fss'>IS MY OWN
SON</span>!”</p>

      <div class='line'>Bitter ere long back on itself recoils.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Earle suddenly reeled at these astounding words, as if
some one had struck him a heavy blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton! Sir!” he cried, aghast, and regarding him
for the moment in helpless amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa!” Editha exclaimed, an expression of utter incredulity
upon her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>She really thought that her father was deranged. She believed
that he had cherished his bitterness toward Earle
until he had become a monomaniac upon that point, and now,
under the excitement of the moment, and their defiance of
him, he had lost his reason entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does all this surprise you, my <em>children</em>?” Mr. Dalton
asked, with a gloating grin at Earle. “It is not to be wondered
at,” he went on; “but it is true, nevertheless. Earle
Wayne, as he calls himself, though he has no more right to
the name than I have, is bone of my bone and flesh of my
flesh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was terribly moved by his speech. His breath came
labored and heavily, his teeth were locked together, and his
hands were clenched until they were fairly livid.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took one fierce stride forward, as if he could have felled
the man to the floor, then suddenly stopped, and asked, in
low, concentrated tones:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Prove what you have said! Is your real name Dalton?”
yet even as he asked the question a cold sweat settled upon
his forehead and about his mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I have always answered to the name of George
Sumner Dalton, though for brevity’s sake I dropped the first
name many years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>George Sumner Dalton!</em>” repeated Earle, mechanically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you have it correct. Do you recognize any part of
it?” was the mocking reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see, I see,” murmured the young man, pressing his hands
upon his temples, and looking as if he was paralyzed with the
suddenness of the intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Then all his mother’s sufferings—all the wrongs and disgraces
of his own early life suddenly surged over him with
overwhelming force, and he turned fiercely upon the man who
dared to stand there and taunt him with those cruel facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then <em>you</em> are the man whom I have been looking for for
seven long years,” he cried. “<em>You</em> are the wretch who plotted
to betray my mother, and you dare stand there and <em>own</em>
the dastardly act—you dare acknowledge the deed that makes
you a man to be shunned and despised by all true, good men,
brands you worse than a second Cain, and makes me loathe
you until my very soul is sick, notwithstanding that the same
blood may flow in our veins?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle! Earle! <em>what</em> are you saying?” cried Editha, wildly,
and springing to his side, as the burning words fell with
almost blighting force from his lips. “Spare him, Earle—I
do not think he knows what he has been saying; this wild,
wild story cannot be true; he must be <em>mad</em>!” And she clung
to him, trembling in every limb, her teeth chattering with
nervousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle himself shuddered as her words fell upon his ear,
and his very heart seemed dying within him as he bent a
look of keenest anguish upon her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton his father and hers!</p>

<p class='c007'>Could any torture more horrible than the knowledge of that
fact be poured out upon him?</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet he saw that she did not credit the story—ay, it seemed
too wild for any one to credit. But he knew it was true.</p>

<p class='c007'>He put his arm around her and led her to a seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling—my darling!” he cried, in a voice of despair,
“can we ever bear it? I thought our sorrows were all at an
end; they have but just begun. God give us both strength
to bear it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle,” she said, with a piteous look into his quivering
face, “you <em>do</em> not believe what he has said? Oh!” clasping
her hands with a frightened look, “just think what it means,
if it <em>should</em> be true. You <em>do</em> not believe it, Earle?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed his head until his forehead touched her golden
hair, and groaned aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling, I believe the knowledge will kill me, but <em>I
know that it is true</em>,” he said, in a hoarse and unnatural voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>She shrank from his sheltering arm with a cry that rang
in his ears for years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Folding his arms tight across his breast, as if to keep his
hands from performing a swift and terrible vengeance, Earle
instantly turned and faced the man who owned himself his
father.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“You <em>know</em> it, do you?” Mr. Dalton said, before he could
speak. “You own the relationship, then? You know all your
mother’s story, and how she cheated me, and kept me from
the knowledge of who she was, the position she occupied, and
the great wealth she was to inherit some day? If she had told
<em>me</em>, I should to-day have been the father of the Marquis of
Wycliffe, and occupying one of the proudest positions in England.
I would have married her honorably if she had told
me, but she cheated me out of a magnificent fortune, and I
stand here to-day a ruined man, a beggar. Do you wonder
that I hated <em>you</em>, for her sake, when I found out who you
were? Do you wonder that I have always hated Marion
Vance for defrauding me thus?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold!” cried Earle, so sternly that he stopped involuntarily.
“Do not dare to take my mother’s pure name upon
your vile lips, nor vent your petty spite upon her for what
you were <em>alone</em> to blame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Pure name!</em>” burst forth the furious man, recklessly.
“Doubtless you are very proud of it—the name that you
should bear instead of the one you do. But I have had my
revenge, or at least a part of it; for, if through her obstinacy
I lost the glory which should have been mine, I did not suffer
alone—she was driven out, a nameless outcast, from her ancestral
home, never to enter there again, while her proud inheritance
descended to another branch of the family, though
I don’t know who, and made her offspring a beggar. If she
had only told me that night in London,” he went on, talking
more to himself than to any one else, “I would gladly have
married her on the spot. But she didn’t; when she found
I wouldn’t compromise myself, she let her pride ruin both her
and me; and <em>how</em> I have hated her ever since. But her
suffering was the greater, and I know her sensitive soul
must have nearly died within her at the idea of entailing her
disgrace upon her offspring. Ah! if I could have found her
after that, I’d have made her pay the penalty for cheating
me so,” he concluded, with intense bitterness, remembering
what he had lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not forget that <em>you</em> were the traitor,” Earle said.
“You lured her on to destruction with soft words and smiles;
you won her pure heart, and tempted her into a secret marriage,
professing to love her as simple Marion Vance, and
for the innocent love she lavished upon you. You did all
this to <em>amuse</em> yourself and <em>pass away an idle summer</em>. She
believed you, and trusted in your honor, and she gloried in
her secret, because of the joyful surprise she would be able
to give you when you should go with her to her father to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>confess that she was your wife. If you had been true to her,
if you had not tried to play that dastardly trick upon her,
you might have attained to the greatness which your mean
and ambitious soul coveted. You <em>cheated yourself</em>, and
now the meanest of all traits that weak human nature is heir
to is revealed in you—<em>you hate the one you sought to injure,
simply because you overreached yourself, and the wrong recoiled
in a measure upon you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton glared angrily at him, for Earle read his
degraded nature like an open book, and it was by no means
pleasant to be compelled to view the picture he had drawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You appear to know all about your mother’s history,” he
said at last, with some curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” he answered, with a look of pain; “I know it all—how
she suffered when you did not come to her—how anxious
she grew when she discovered that her honor must be vindicated,
and you did not even write to her in answer to her
heart-rending appeals—how she determined that she would
be acknowledged as your lawful wife, and sought you in London
one dismal night, and begged you, with all the eloquence
which she could command, to right the wrong you had done
her. Had you consented, she resolved to tell you then and
there of the brilliant future awaiting you. But you spurned
her from you instead—you turned coldly from her and her
almost idolatrous love, mocking her misery, and telling her
that the woman you married must be endowed with wealth
and position—if she could assure you of these, you would consent
to make her an honorable wife; but you would not
marry her to save her from the shame that you had brought
upon her. Then it was that she learned your utter heartlessness—that
you cared for nothing or for no one but yourself
and the things that would serve to gratify your selfish
ambition. She would not be an <em>unloved</em> wife, and she knew
that when you should discover the greatness you had missed
you would be rightly punished; and so, in her pride, she
turned from you in silence regarding her prospects, vowing
that she would not wed you then if it would save both
your lives; she resolved to bear her shame alone, knowing
that the day was not far distant when you would be willing
to sacrifice much to undo that wrong—when you would
curse yourself for your folly. I judge from your words
to-day that that time did come—that you suffered keenly
when you discovered that the trap you had set for your
victim had also sprung on yourself. As I said before, you
are the man for whom I have been searching for the last
seven years—that was the business upon which I went that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>night when this house was robbed, and returning became
entangled in the affair. I thought I had gained a clew to
the whereabouts of a George Sumner, and I meant, if I
found you, to brand you the traitor and the coward that you
are——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Softly—softly, young man,” interrupted Sumner Dalton,
a white light gleaming from his eyes. “I suppose you
mean by that that you would like to pommel me within an
inch of my life; but this is a country which does not permit
such things—there are penalties for such indiscretions as
those, and as you have already served one term for the
benefit of the State, I hardly think you would enjoy another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh, how the heart of Earle Wayne rebelled against this
insult! But he knew that retribution did not always fall
upon the offender in the form of blows, and he answered,
with quiet scorn:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mistake, sir. I would not degrade myself enough
to lay even a finger upon you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This shot told; Earle could see by the twitching of the
muscles about his mouth, and the sudden clenching of his
hands, and he replied, with malevolent spite:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; what you say is true—I am the George Sumner
who enticed Marion Vance into secret marriage. I got Austin
Osgood to perform the ceremony—a clever fellow, and
always up to all sorts of mischief; but the scamp has never
shown his face to me since, for some unaccountable reason.
I must confess I did feel a little squeamish and sorry for the
girl when she took on so; but when I found how she had
deceived me, I had not a regret—I gloried in her shame, and
the shame she must entail upon her offspring. I gloried
in the suffering I knew she would experience, as day after
day she looked upon her child and thought of the noble
inheritance she had deprived it of by her folly. A week after
she came to me one of my friends told me the story of
Marion Vance’s dishonor—how that all the world knew then
that she had been driven from her father’s house in disgrace.
It was then that I learned <em>who</em> she was and <em>what</em>
I had lost. I left everything and began to search for her,
resolved I would make her marry me, so that our child might
be born in wedlock and inherit the estates of Wycliffe. But
she had hidden herself so securely that she could not be
found, and, when the time had passed that must elapse before
her child was born, I gave up the search and returned
to America. But I had learned to hate her with all the
strength of my nature, and if by any means I had ever encountered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>her, I would have crushed her as relentlessly
as I would crush a reptile. When I discovered that you
were her son, I knew that through you I could doubtless
make her suffer, and I meant to crush you, too. Now
you know why I have been your bitter foe for all these
years,” he concluded, with a look so baleful that Earle
turned away in disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My mother is forever beyond your reach—she died more
than seven years ago,” he said, solemnly. A slight shiver
disturbed Sumner Dalton’s frame, but he made no reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you discover that I was Marion Vance’s child?”
Earle asked, after a few moments of silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton laughed, but a feeling of shame made him
color, notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you remember leaving a package of papers
with Richard Forrester for safe keeping while you were
absent for three years,” he said, recklessly. “He left them
with Editha when he died, and, I being somewhat curious
to know what was so carefully guarded by so large a seal,
I took the liberty to inspect them, little thinking that I should
discover so <em>near</em> and <em>dear</em> a relative by so doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha here started up, and, lifting her white face from
her trembling hands, cried out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shame!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; a very respectful way of addressing a parent,”
Mr. Dalton sneered, while Earle’s lip curled disdainfully,
and a hot flush again mounted to his brow. “I must
say, however,” Mr. Dalton continued, “that the package was
not worthy of the effort it cost me to open it, and contained
nothing of interest to me beyond the pictures and writing
that proved to me you were Marion Vance’s child, unless,
I except some hieroglyphics on a piece of cardboard that I
could not read.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s expression was a peculiar one, as he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you examine that piece of cardboard critically?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I tossed it one side when I found I could not
read it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have it with me now—I always carry it with me, for
it contains matter of the most vital importance to me, and
might possibly interest you considerably.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He drew it from his pocket as he spoke, and held it so
that Mr. Dalton could see the writing in cipher.</p>

<p class='c007'>He recognized it instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These hieroglyphics, as you call them, merely tell what
the cardboard contains.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“What it contains!” repeated Mr. Dalton, his curiosity
now fully aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>To him it appeared only a single piece of rather heavy
cardboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; if you had examined it carefully you would have
noticed that it is apparently composed of three layers, but
the middle one is cut out very near the edge, so as to allow
of some closely written sheets of thin paper to be inserted.
I remove one end of what appears the middle layer—thus,
and you perceive that the papers easily slide out of their
pocket.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He held it upside down, gave it a little shake, and some
very thin sheets of paper, upon which there was writing,
with another long, narrow slip which was not so thin, fell
upon the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This, perhaps, may contain something of interest to you,”
Earle said, taking the latter up and holding it before Mr.
Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the marriage certificate which the old rector had
given Marion on the evening of her marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>He laughed long, loud, and scornfully as he saw it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I always thought Austin Osgood carried matters a little
too far when he dared to sign the old rector’s name to a
real marriage certificate, and give it to Marion. But I
suppose it made it seem more real to the girl, only I wonder
at her keeping the useless paper after she discovered the
fraud. As for Austin, I told you before, I never saw him
again. Perhaps he, also, thought he had gone too far in the
matter, and was afraid he might be overhauled for forgery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle did not make any reply to these remarks; he merely
returned the certificate to the cardboard pocket and took
up another paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is some information that I stumbled upon purely
by accident—no, I should not say that,” he added, in a
reverent tone; “I ought to say, a Divine Providence led
me to it. Shall I read it to you, or will you read it for yourself?
It is very closely connected with that little drama in
St. John’s Chapel at Winchelsea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton moved uneasily in his chair. Somehow the
words of this grave, calm young man, with his self-contained
bearing, and a suspicion of great reserve force about
him, made him feel as if he might have the advantage in
his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to fear that those papers might contain something
very disagreeable, and something that had been reserved
especially for him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>What could Earle Wayne have been searching for him
for during all these years?</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely not merely to acquaint him with the fact that he
knew he was the illegitimate son of himself and Marion
Vance.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he held out his hand for the paper, preferring to
read it for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle gave it to him, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is simply a copy of something in Bishop Grafton’s
diary. I made it myself from the original.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton unfolded that paper with a feeling of
great uneasiness, and began to read how the sexton had
confessed the trouble on his mind to the rector—how the
old man had himself gone to the chapel, and, concealing
himself, had seen a young man come into the robing-room,
disguise himself, and then proceed to assume the sacred
vestures.</p>

<p class='c007'>He read how the rector had interposed, ascertained the
names of the young couple, driven the accomplice ignominiously
from the field, filled out and signed the marriage
certificate, and then himself proceeded to the chapel and
married the unsuspecting pair.</p>

<p class='c007'>A terrible oath leaped from Sumner Dalton’s lips, and
the paper dropped from his nerveless hand, as he finished
reading this startling revelation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a lie!” he cried, his face ashen, and a great fear
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is no lie,” Earle returned, sternly. “I went myself
to see the place where I supposed my gentle mother had
been so cruelly deceived. I sought the sexton, and he
told me concerning his part in the transaction, and then
directed me to Bishop Grafton’s daughter for further information,
he being dead. She was only too glad to aid me—told
me of her father’s diary, and what she had read of
this there. She then brought it to me, and kindly allowed
me to make this copy. The signature upon the marriage
certificate corresponds exactly with his own in the journal,
and Miss Grafton is perfectly willing that any one interested
or concerned in this matter should see the original.
There is a little more,” Earle added, taking up another paper,
“which I think will convince you beyond a doubt of the
truth of what you have already read.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then read himself aloud how the good man’s heart
had been troubled on account of the young and tender
maiden, and, fearing that some great trouble might come
to her, he had resolved to make that last entry in his diary;</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“<span class='sc'>Married</span>—In St. John’s Chapel, Winchelsea, August 11th,
18—, by the Reverend Joshua Grafton, bishop, and rector of
St. John’s parish, George Sumner, of Rye, to Miss Marion
Vance, also of Rye. I take my oath that this is a true statement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“September 10th, 18—.      <span class='sc'>Joshua Grafton</span>, Rector.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For what seemed a long time after the reading of this,
Sumner Dalton sat as if turned to stone, his face white as
his shirt-bosom, his eyes wild and staring, and his hands
locked together in a painful clasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then starting up with an exclamation of horror, he cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I have been doubly cheated and duped. No wonder
that Austin Osgood never dared to come near me again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And,” Earle said, quietly and impressively, “Marion
Vance’s honor was never marred by the shadow of a stain,
though she suffered the same as if it had been, and—<em>her
son was not born illegitimate</em>!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br> <span class='large'>“I OWE YOU NOTHING”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, why did I not know of this?” groaned Sumner Dalton,
beating his brow with his hands. “I was, after all,
the legal husband of the heiress of Wycliffe. All these years
I might have occupied that proud position, and with unlimited
wealth at my command. It is too much—too much to
bear. What evil genius has been pursuing me all my life,
that I should have missed it all?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That ‘evil genius,’ as you term it, was but your own
villainy—the spirit that rules in your own evil heart. You
sought to ruin an innocent girl, and you overreached yourself.
For once justice and punishment has been meted
out where it belongs, and you have no one to blame for it
but yourself,” Earle answered, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis <em>false</em>! She should have told me. She had no
right to hide the knowledge from me—her husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You forget that you scorned her, and told her she had
no claim upon you, and also that you refused to give her
any right to call you husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But she had no business to consent to marry me under
such false pretenses. ’Twas <em>she</em> who has kept me from
my rights, when I might have been master of Wycliffe all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>these years—twenty-five years of glory and honor lost. It
is <em>too</em> much; and if I could make her feel my vengeance
now I would,” he groaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle turned from him, almost sick with disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was like many other people who have sought to do
another some irreparable injury. He hated his blameless
victim because, having overreached himself, the wrong had
at last rebounded upon himself, and he was the chief sufferer
from his own folly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gentle Marion Vance had done him no conscious wrong.
She had loved and trusted him; she would have devoted
her life to him and his interests. But, although he had
not really succeeded in destroying her, and entailing lasting
dishonor upon her name, yet she had suffered for the time
as if he had accomplished his purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the truth had triumphed at last, as it always does.
He stood exposed in all his baseness; his evil doings were
revealed, and the shame and injury done to himself were
far greater than he had ever dreamed of bringing upon
her. Marion at last stood vindicated before the world as
the pure and innocent girl she was, while the whole black
catalogue of Sumner Dalton’s guilt was now sweeping down
like an avalanche upon him, threatening to ruin and crush
him utterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He might live ten, twenty, even thirty years longer, but
his treachery would follow him forever; it would never be
forgotten by any one who had known of it. Henceforth
he would be a marked man, and one never more to be
trusted or honored.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay!” Mr. Dalton suddenly exclaimed, as if a new
thought had struck him. “The legal husband of Marion
Vance would have rights there even now. I will see to
this matter. Who has been master at Wycliffe all these
years?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Warrenton Fairfield Vance, my mother’s father, has ruled
there until his death, which occurred only a few months ago,”
Earle answered, quietly, but reading at once what was passing
in the man’s mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who came into the property then?” he demanded,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A cousin of my mother’s—Paul Tressalia by name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Zounds! Girl, do you hear that?” exclaimed Mr. Dalton,
very much astonished, and turning to Editha. “But——” he
began again, with a perplexed look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he is not master there now,” Earle interrupted,
calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“Ah!” Mr. Dalton uttered, leaning forward with breathless
interest, half expecting what was to follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>I</em> am now the acknowledged Marquis of Wycliffe and
Viscount Wayne,” Earle said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you proved your claim? Was it not contested?
How——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton was very much excited, so much so that he
trembled visibly, and leaned back, white and weak, in his
chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have proved my claim; it was not contested,” the
young man began. “When I first discovered that my
mother’s marriage was valid, and that I was the rightful
heir to Wycliffe, I thought I would go at once and compel
my grandfather to acknowledge me as such. But he had
been so stern and cruel to my mother that I recoiled from
him. I was under age, and I knew he would be apt to
deal sternly with me also, and demand implicit obedience
to him. I knew if I went to him he would in all probability
refuse to allow me to follow the course I had marked
out for myself. So I resolved I would never cross the
threshold over which my mother had been so relentlessly
driven until I had either discovered the man who had so
wronged her, and could tell the marquis that I had found
him and proved that he had legally bound himself to her, or
until his death, when of course it would become necessary
that I should reveal my identity. So I began my lonely wanderings
upon a very uncertain mission. I discovered upon
inquiry that a George Sumner had been studying at a certain
German university. I immediately repaired thither, and
found, upon examining the books, that he was an American
from a certain town in the State of New York. And now
allow me to ask why you registered only a part of your
name instead of the whole?” Earle asked, pausing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It does not matter,” Mr. Dalton muttered, uneasily, and
with a rising flush.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might as well be mentioned here what Earle afterward
discovered, that he became implicated in a very shameful
affair while studying in a noted college of his own
country, and was expelled in deep disgrace, whereupon he
had immediately gone abroad to finish his course in the
German university referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fearing that there might be other American students there
who knew of the disgraceful affair in which he had been
a leader, he resolved not to give his whole name, and thus
escaped being a marked man.</p>

<p class='c007'>He accordingly gave only his first two names, and though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>there were, as he feared, other students there who did know
of the escapade connected with his previous college life,
yet they never suspected that George Sumner and George
Dalton, as he had before been known, were the same person.
With a slight curl of his lip at the man’s reply, Earle continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as I found he was an American, I resolved to
come to America and prosecute my search. But I was a
poor boy; I had refused the aid which my grandfather had
hitherto given my mother—I could not use the money of
a man who had so long disowned me, even though it might
belong to me by right—and so I was obliged to do something
for my support. That was how I came to be in Mr.
Forrester’s employ; and every holiday, every spare day that
he would grant me, I devoted to my search. I procured the
directories of several cities, and studied up all the Sumners
they contained, but could find none, upon seeking them out,
who answered to the George Sumner that my dying mother
had described to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never thought of such a thing as you being the man
I was seeking; had I even suspected it, I never should have
had to serve those three years in that miserable prison; for,
as I told you before, it was while searching for you that
I became entangled in that robbery. You, it seems, knew,
during the greater part of my imprisonment, of the relation
I sustained toward you. It would seem as if common
humanity would have prompted you to make some effort
for my release, or, at least, for a mitigation of my sentence;
but instead, you sought to deprive me of the only comfort
I had, for I am convinced that it was you who intercepted
all the flowers and kind messages which I should otherwise
have received.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle fixed his stern glance upon Mr. Dalton as he said
this, and knew by the guilty way his eyes fell that he was
correct in his surmise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not wonder at it, now that I know something of your
nature, but it will only be an added thorn planted in your
pillow of remorse, as will also be the injuries which you
sought to do me after my release, and in the end you will
be the worst sufferer. But in spite of your every effort
I conquered. I was beginning to make for myself a name
and reputation, when I read in a paper of the death of
the Marquis of Wycliffe. He had been dead some time,
for this notice was only an item gleaned from European
news, and reported in connection with the fact that Mr.
Tressalia, of Newport fame, had succeeded to his vast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>property. I knew then that I must attend to my claim at
once, and I immediately left for Europe. I found Mr. Tressalia,
as I expected, already established as the Marquis
of Wycliffe; but, like the noble man that he is, when he
found that I was the rightful heir he relinquished everything
and kindly assisted me in establishing my identity. Then,
feeling that the change in my prospects would be sufficient
to make you waive all objections regarding me, I left my
affairs in his hands, and returned for Editha——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle suddenly stopped appalled—he could not go on. All
his dreams of happiness were at an end now; that hour
had crushed his every hope—Editha Dalton was his half-sister,
and he must never dare to think of her again as becoming
his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, God forgive him! he could never love her as a
sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>His great heart swelled within him with agony at the
thought; the veins upon his forehead filled out hard and
full, while the perspiration gathered upon his face, and,
rolling off, dropped upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha Dalton his half-sister!</p>

<p class='c007'>He could not realize it, and it was the bitterest blow his
life had ever known. How could he live all the long years
that were before him, with the sin of this undying love
clinging to him?</p>

<p class='c007'>Now he knew something of what Paul Tressalia must
have suffered from his unrequited affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia!</p>

<p class='c007'>The thought of him thrilled him with a sharper, fiercer
pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps in time, now that Editha was lost to him, he
might succeed in winning her.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was too much for him to bear silently, and, bowing
his head upon the table near which he had sat down, he
groaned aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton smiled at the sound, while a cunning, sinister
expression crept into his eyes. It did him good to know
that Earle could suffer, and his strange hatred of him on his
mother’s account made him inwardly exult over the sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he had been revolving matters of importance in his
mind while Earle was talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been immeasurably startled and mortified to learn
how the rector of St. John’s chapel at Winchelsea had outwitted
him, and fearfully angry and irritated when he realized
how he had missed all the luxuries and magnificence
of Wycliffe for so many years.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>If he had only known that the marriage had been legal
when he had opened that package and discovered that Earle
was his son and heir of all the Marquis of Wycliffe’s great
possessions, how differently he would have conducted himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>If he could but have known what that piece of cardboard
contained—if he could have read all this evidence
then, and assured himself of its truth, as he would have
taken pains to have done, how eagerly he would have worked
for Earle’s release, and canceled every evidence of the evil
passion within him. He would then have made peace with
him, and have reaped all the advantages which the father
of so noted a person as the future Marquis of Wycliffe would be
would naturally enjoy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a faint hope animated him that perhaps it might
not be too late, after all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was his son—that fact was established beyond a
doubt—and he had said he would never stoop to anything
like revenge; he had once said that he would not avail
himself of the slightest advantage to do him an injury; he
had also said that he desired to put in practice the mandate,
“Love your enemies, do good to those who despitefully
injure you.” If that was the case he would doubtless
be ready to forgive him for all the wrong he had done
him in the past, and if he expressed sorrow in a proper
manner he would doubtless receive him into favor, and he
could after all be able to worm himself into Wycliffe and
be looked up to and honored as the father of the young
marquis. It was strange that no feelings of guilt or shame
restrained him. He did not hate Marion one whit the less,
nor Earle either, because he henceforth might be able to
enjoy what had so long been denied him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he was resolved to make the fact of their relationship
serve him a good turn; he would get all he could out
of him, gratify every selfish desire, accept every good thing
that he could possibly worm out of him, and let all the
former wrong he had done him go for naught.</p>

<p class='c007'>He still hated him, I say, as such natures always hate
those who have risen triumphant above them, and he would
have gloried in it if he could have hurled him from his
proud position and made the whole world despise and hate
him likewise; but, as long as there was any prospect of
advantage to be gained for himself, he must hide it and put
on the semblance of regret and future good-will.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say that your claim is indisputably established at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Wycliffe?” he asked, after he had thought these things well
over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” Earle answered, lifting his haggard face, with a
heavy sigh; “everything was so clearly proved that no one
could gainsay it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is exceedingly fortunate. When shall you return?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Immediately,” Earle said, with white lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you find the estates and rent-roll?” Mr. Dalton
asked, with another cunning gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a very flourishing condition,” Earle answered briefly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was beginning to mistrust toward what these inquiries
were tending.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what will you do? You have never had any experience
in managing so large a property.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can learn, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know; but that would be so tedious, and you are liable
to make many mistakes. You need some one older and wiser
than yourself to advise you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton hesitates a moment and leans nearer Earle,
eagerly searching his handsome face. But Earle sits pale
and quiet, knowing, nevertheless, what is to follow, and conscious
also of what the result will be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If—if,” began Mr. Dalton, with some hesitation, “you
could be—ahem!—persuaded to—to overlook the past—if we
could make a treaty to bury the hatchet, and be at peace.
I—I really regret, you know, all that has gone by—and if
we could come to some sort of terms, I—would consent
to return to Wycliffe with you, and give you the benefit of
my superior judgment and advice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such amazing disinterestedness, such unblushing assurance
was absolutely startling.</p>

<p class='c007'>A quick, hot flush mounted to Earle’s brow, and for a
moment his lips trembled as if scathing and terrible words
rushed unbidden there for utterance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he lifted his dark eyes and fixed them in a quiet,
steady gaze upon the man opposite him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton could not meet that gaze unmoved. In
spite of his hardihood, a blush of confusion mantled his
face, and his guilty look told that all sense of shame was
not yet quite dead within him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I was simply Earle Wayne,” he began, without
removing his glance, “a poor boy working for his daily
bread, I was considered unworthy of your notice. When
misfortune overtook me and I became a criminal in the
sight of the law, even after you knew that it was your son
who had been sentenced to hard labor for three years, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>made no effort to help me—you did not come near me to
offer me one kind and sympathizing word even. When your
daughter was kind to me, and I dared to feel a tender regard
for her, you resolved to crush me. When a kind friend
remembered me on his death-bed, you would have wrested
from me the comparatively small sum that he had bequeathed
to me out of his abundance. You have scorned,
insulted, and wronged me in every possible way. You have
even owned to an implacable enmity toward me. For all this
I could forgive you, if convinced that you were truly repentant,
since it was against me alone that all your malice
and hatred were turned; but for the slight, the scorn, and
the misery which you plotted, and, to all intents and purposes,
executed against my gentle and innocent mother, I cannot.
I have no right to forgive you. By your own wickedness
and folly you have forfeited all right to be acknowledged as
either her husband or my father. Mr. Dalton, <em>you</em> can never
cross the threshold of Wycliffe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had listened to Earle with a sinking heart, and when
he concluded he fairly gnashed his teeth from anger and
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle had spoken very quietly. There was not the slightest
excitement visible in his manner, but every word had in
it the ring of an unalterable purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean it?” Mr. Dalton asked, in low, repressed
tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most emphatically, sir; <em>you</em> can never enter the home
from which my mother was driven in disgrace on account
of your baseness and treachery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton sat in sullen thought for awhile. How he
hated this calm, proud young man, from whom, even though
he was his own son, he knew he had no right to expect
anything of respect or consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the things of the world were desperate with him just
at present, and he controlled his fierce passion to make one
last appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was true that Editha still had her fortune, and while
she still remained single he knew he need not want for anything
within reason; still he could not in any way control
her property, and all he received had to come through her
hands, which, to a man so proud and spirited as himself,
was, to say the least, humiliating.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if he could but once lay hand upon the overflowing
coffers of Wycliffe his future would be one long day of
luxury and pleasure, and, having been wronged out of his
share for so many years, he would feel no compunctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>about scattering with lavish hand the shining treasure of
the house of Vance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will be frank with you,” he said, trying to speak in
a conciliatory tone. “I am a ruined man. I have been
speculating, and every dollar of my handsome property is
gone. Even my house and furniture are mortgaged, and
liable to be taken from me any day. I say again I regret
the past sincerely;” and so he did, so much of it as had
served to keep him out of Wycliffe, though no part of his
sin. “I wish to be at peace with you, but if you turn against
me now, I must come down to the level of the common
herd.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the level of the common herd! How the words galled
Earle. He would sink to the level of the common herd, of
which he had once believed his mother was one, and so
it had not mattered if he had ruined her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bitter words arose to his lips; his heart was full of scorn
and indignation, but he controlled it, and answered, as calmly
as before, but with an unmoved face:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I regret that you have been so unfortunate—speculating
is very precarious business, but I can never consent to your
becoming an inmate of Wycliffe, or of the home where I
reside. It would not be right that I should overlook the
past and treat you as if you had been guilty of no wrong;
you have no right to expect me to entertain anything of
either respect or affection for you, even though the same
blood may flow in our veins—you have forfeited all right
and title to any such feelings. I must, on the other hand,
frankly confess to an aversion for you, but I would harbor
no ill-will, I would do you no injury even though I cannot
tolerate your presence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is this your creed?” burst forth Mr. Dalton, unable to
control himself any longer. “Is this your boasted forgiveness
of your enemies—your ‘good-will toward men?’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not <em>wish</em> to be forgiven—you have no <em>real
sorrow</em> for your sin. If any effort of mine could serve to
make you truly repentant before God, I would not spare
it. If you were sick and needy, I would minister to you,
for my Master’s sake, as I would to any other stranger.
But your feelings toward me are unchanged—were it not
for what I <em>possess</em>, you would not even now make these
overtures to me, and all idea of our residing under the same
roof, or of sharing anything in common, is entirely out of the
question. Still, I repeat, I bear you no malice, or cherish no
spirit of revenge toward you, and to prove it, since you have
been so unfortunate, I will make over to you, if Editha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>does not object, the ten thousand dollars which Mr. Forrester
bequeathed to me, and which has remained untouched
since she invested it for me. The interest of that will give
you a comfortable living during the remainder of your life,
if you do not touch the principal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A perfect tornado of wrath raged in Sumner Dalton’s
breast at this calmly spoken but unalterable decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you will deign to give me, <em>your father</em>, a paltry ten
thousand out of your exhaustless revenue!” he sneered, with
exceeding bitterness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I owe you <em>nothing</em> on the score of relationship,” Earle
answered, coldly; “and as for the ‘paltry ten thousand,’ allow
me to remind you that you did not consider it in that light
when Mr. Forrester bequeathed it to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Mr. Dalton flushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>How all his sins, one after another, were being visited
upon himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a fearful look of rage and hate convulsing his
features, he leaned toward Earle and hissed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would crush you this instant if I could; there is nothing
of all the world’s ills too horrible for me to wish upon
you, and I will yet be revenged upon you for what I have
suffered this day. I will yet make you feel the power of
my hate!” and he glanced darkly toward Editha as he said
this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s eyes involuntarily followed his look, and the bitterness
of death seemed upon him as he realized that they
two would have a life-long sorrow to bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sudden fear startled him, as Mr. Dalton spoke, that
he contemplated injury to her in order to carry out the
revenge he meant to wreak upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be very careful <em>what</em> you do,” he said, with a
sternness that cowed the man in spite of his bravado; “you
will not forget that you occupy a very delicate position even
now, and that I have it in my power to make your own
future very uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?” demanded Mr. Dalton, with glittering
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean that if I choose I can make you answerable
to the law; for, while one wife was living, you married
another, and are liable at any time to be prosecuted for
bigamy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sumner Dalton swore a fearful oath, his white face testifying
to the dreadful punishment which anything of such
a nature would be to him, while a low, heart-rending moan
burst at the same moment from Editha.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIV<br> <span class='large'>“IS THERE NO WAY OF ESCAPE?”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Earle started at that sound. His mind was so intent upon
dealing with the strange man who claimed to be his father
that he had not considered how his words might wound
Editha, and he now blamed himself severely for having allowed
these disclosures to be made in her presence. What
must the poor girl have suffered as she listened and realized
her own position, and all the wrong of which her father
was guilty?</p>

<p class='c007'>He had proved that her father had been legally married
to his mother, consequently he, who had hitherto been regarded
as a child of dishonor, was now without taint, and
entitled to one of the proudest positions in the world. But
in the heat and excitement of explaining all this, he had not
stopped to consider that his own glory must necessarily arise
out of the ruins of her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Mr. Dalton had failed in his search for Marion
Vance he returned to the United States, where, shortly after,
he had met and married the sister of Richard Forrester, who
was reputed to be quite wealthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disappointment awaited him in this, however, for Miss
Forrester possessed but a small sum in her own right.</p>

<p class='c007'>But matters could not be helped, and the chagrined husband
made the most of it, invested his wife’s small fortune
carefully, and, by earnest attention to business, made money
steadily for several years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Report said, also, that Richard Forrester gave him a handsome
lift, and it was not long before he was reputed to be
the possessor of a large fortune.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, of course, his marriage with Miss Forrester was not
legal, although he had confidently believed it to be so until
this very day; and Earle condemned himself for many things
that he had said, after being reminded by that low moan
of how much Editha had been made to suffer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton saw how it wounded him, and laughed maliciously,
whereupon Earle turned upon him almost savagely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean me to understand that you will wound
me by venting your malice upon her? Let me assure you
that if I know of your willfully causing her even one moment’s
unhappiness, I will have no mercy on you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton chuckled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are really fond of—ah—your <em>sister</em>; it is really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>pleasant to see such unity in a family. I trust you will always
be as fond of your—<em>sister</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He seemed to take a satanic delight in repeating the word.
He knew that it fell upon both their hearts like the blow
from a hammer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sister! God forgive me, she <em>is</em> my sister; but I do not
love her <em>as such</em>,” Earle groaned, as he wiped the cold sweat
from his forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was music to Sumner Dalton’s ears, but he knew
it would not do to trespass too far; so, rising, he said, with
the most consummate coolness:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Since it would not sound well for a man in your position
to allow his father to suffer for the necessaries of life,
I will consent to accept your offer of that ten thousand,
and you can make it over to me with as little delay as possible.
And now I will bid you good-morning, leaving you
and your <em>sister</em> to talk over your future prospects and comfort
one another as best you can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a low, echoing, mocking laugh, he left the room and
those two wretched young people were alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the exceeding bitterness of his soul Earle again dropped
his head upon the table, and a long, long silence ensued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha lay perfectly still upon the sofa.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last Earle arose and went and knelt down beside her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha!” he said; and it is not possible to convey any
idea of the pain crowded into the one word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only a low moan answered him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha,” he said again, almost wildly, “I would have saved
you from this had it been possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned her face up to him at this in speechless misery.
She had shed no tears over what she had heard; the horror
of it had seemed to scorch and burn them up at their very
fountain. Her eyes were heavy, her face perfectly hueless,
her lips parched and drawn, her hands hot and burning.</p>

<p class='c007'>That one look of hers, so piteous and full of anguish, unmanned
Earle completely, and, dropping his head upon the
pillow beside hers, sob after sob broke from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the sight of his suffering, woman-like, she forgot her
own in a measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>She put up her hot hand and laid it caressingly against his
cheek, and cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle—Earle—don’t! <em>I</em> cannot bear it if <em>you</em> give way
so. God will help us; He will send no more upon us than
He is willing to give us strength to bear. But, oh!”
she added, wildly, “that I should have to call <em>such</em> a man
<em>father</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“My darling, that is a sorrow that we share in common,”
Earle answered, with an effort at self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad mamma is dead. I am glad Uncle Richard
is dead. How could they have borne this?” Editha moaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your Uncle Richard would have counseled us what to
do, dear; he would have been a help to us,” Earle replied,
feeling deeply the need of such a friend as Richard Forrester
would have been.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe he would have killed papa if he had lived to
know of all this. I have been told that his temper was
fearful when once aroused,” Editha said, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is not here, and we must take counsel of each other.
My darling we have some stern facts to look in the face.
All——”</p>

<p class='c007'>His courage failed him for the moment, and it seemed
as if his reason was forsaking him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a while he went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“All our former hopes are crushed and destroyed. Oh,
why were we ever permitted to love each other as we have
done, only to suffer thus? But, Editha, I cannot—I do not
feel that I ought to go back and leave you here with <em>him</em>.
Will you come with me to Wycliffe and share my home—your
<em>brother’s</em> home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She put him away from her with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cry of bitterness rang through the room, and then, as
if all power of self-control had deserted her, she cried out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, <em>no</em>, <span class='fss'>NO</span>! Earle, how can you torture me with such
a proposal? Go away—hide from me—put the sea between
us, until—<em>until I can learn to love you less</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the poor, tired, almost bursting heart found relief
in a flood of scalding tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was glad to see her weep, though every word had
been fresh torture to him. He did not check her, but only
knelt by her, gently smoothing her shining hair, and wishing
he could have borne all this great grief alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>How could he bear to leave her? How could he put the
ocean between them! How could he bear to let long years
go by and not look upon her face, perhaps <em>never</em> see her
again? She would not be happy with her father, he knew,
after what she had learned to-day. She had no other friends
to whom to go, and what would become of her?</p>

<p class='c007'>She repelled the idea of making Wycliffe her home, where
she would be obliged to see him every day, and strive to
conquer the love which now she had no right to give him.
And his own heart told him that it would be a burden too
heavy for either of them to bear.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Something told him that he could never love her after
the quiet fashion of a brother. His heart had gone out to
her in the first strong, deep passion of his manhood, and
he could no more control it than he could control the wind
that blew.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this he thought over as she lay there in the abandonment
of her grief, and he knew that she had judged rightly;
they must be separated, or their sorrow would wear them
both out in a little while. He must go back to Wycliffe and
take up his duties there, and she must choose for herself what
she would do here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her sobs grew less violent after awhile, and at last he said,
with an effort to speak calmly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, I will do whatever you say; but it seems to me
as if all the world from this hour will be palled in deepest
gloom—as if nothing could ever look bright or beautiful
again. I came back to you so joyous—so proud of the position
that was mine to offer you; and now every hope is
crushed. Oh, what shall we do? How are we to bear it?”
he groaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must go away—back to England,” she said, in a
shaking, weakened voice. “I cannot bear it if you stay here;
neither can I go to Wycliffe. Don’t you see we could not
bear <em>that</em>? We must live apart, and strive to forget if we
can. Perhaps when long years have passed, if we live, and
we have not seen each other, we may be able to love each
other less.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“God forbid! And yet the sin of it will crush me,” he
cried, despairingly. “I cannot forget—I do not want to
forget—I will <em>not</em>. Oh, Editha, why are we permitted to
be tortured thus?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To teach us, perhaps, that earthly idols are but dust, and
God is supreme. He has said we must put no other in <em>His</em>
place,” she whispered, with a solemnity that awed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have <em>you</em> loved <em>me</em> like that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush!” she answered, with a shiver, and laying her
fingers gently on his lips. “I must not tell you <em>how much</em>.
We have no right to talk of that any more. I want you
to bid me good-by now, Earle, and let it be a long, long
good-by, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling, I <em>cannot</em>; it is too, too cruel,” he moaned;
and, forgetting everything but his deep and mighty love for
her, he gathered her into his arms and clasped her with
such rebellious strength that she was powerless in his embrace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Earle,” she said, with a calmness born of despair, yet
speaking authoritatively, “you must let me go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He instantly released her—he could not disobey her when
she spoke in that tone, but the look on his face made her
cry out with pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forgive me,” she almost sobbed. “I would not wound
you, but we must end this for the sake of both. Will you
do as I wish? Will you go back to Wycliffe at once?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do anything that you bid me, Editha,” he answered,
in a hollow tone, but with a look such as she hoped never
to see again on any mortal face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Earle—I do bid you go—it is right—it will be
best, and—and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had risen, and was standing before him, looking almost
as wan and ghastly as she had looked on that night
when he had found her in the power of Tom Drake.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had stopped suddenly, catching her breath, and she
reeled like a person drunken with wine; but, pressing her
hand to her side, as if to still her fierce heart-throbs she
strove to go on, though every word came with a pant:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, Earle, do not mourn—do not grieve any more than
you can help; it would not be right—you have a noble career
before you, and you must do honor to the name you bear——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are honors to me? What is anything in the world
worth to me <em>now</em>?” he interrupted, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must conquer that reckless spirit, Earle—try not to
think of me any more than it is possible to help; I shall do
very well, I hope. I shall stay with papa, and strive to win
him to better things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her pale lips quivered as she thought how dreary the
world would be when he was gone, and how thankless the
task she had set herself to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a moment she quietly drew off the beautiful ring
he had placed upon her finger and held it out to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must not wear this any more,” she said, brokenly; “it
means too much to me, and I have loved it so dearly for
the sake of what it meant, and I do not wish to even see
anything that can remind me of the—the happiness I have
lost. Take it and put it away, Earle; but if—if——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She caught her breath quickly, while he felt as if he were
turning to stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If ever,” she began again, with a great effort, but looking
so white and deathly that Earle feared she would drop
dead at his feet—“if ever in the future you meet any one
whom you think will make you happy, tell her all about our
sorrow, Earle, and give her this with—my blessing.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“Oh, Heaven! Editha, do you wish to drive me mad?”
he groaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Earle, it is hard—I cannot tell you <em>how</em> hard it
is for me to say this, but I know that what I tell you will
be right for you to do, and—I do want you to be happy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Happy! Do you not know that that word will mock
me all the remainder of my life?” he cried, with exceeding
bitterness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope not, Earle;” and her sweet lips quivered like a
grieved child’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think you will ever know happiness again,
Editha?” Earle asked, almost fiercely, and yet her sad face
smote him for the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it is God’s will,” she answered, with a weariness that
pierced him to his heart’s core; but in her soul she knew
that apart from him the world would never hold any charm
for her again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are some things in life,” she went on, with mournful
sweetness, after a moment, “that we cannot understand—this
trial of ours is one of them. I remember reading somewhere
that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>‘Never morning wore</div>
      <div class='line'>To evening, but some heart did break,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and if that is so, we are not alone in our sorrow; perhaps
all will be well in the end, and we shall live to realize it—let
us trust that it may be so. But, Earle, you have a beautiful
home, and probably there are long years of useful life
before you, but there can be no comfort in a household without
a skilful hand to beautify and direct. Do not forget
what I say—remember that I even wish it, should the time
ever come when you can realize it; and now, Earle,” reaching out
her hands with a sob that seemed wrung from her
against her will, “good-by—God ever bless and keep you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His hands dropped suddenly, and the ring rolled to his
feet; he had not taken it—he had seemed to have no power;
and she, feeling that she could bear no more, turned as if
to leave him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had stood like one stunned while she was speaking.
He could not seem to realize that she really meant this for
her last, long farewell; but, as she turned from him, he
cried out suddenly, in a voice of agony:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha! oh, my lost love, do not leave me thus!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped, her head drooping upon her bosom, her hands
hanging listlessly by her side.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>He sprang to her, and, forgetting everything but the pain
of the moment, he drew her passionately to his breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha—my happiness—my love—all that is dearest and
best in the world, how can you go away from me so? I
cannot bear it. I will not believe this fearful thing that is to
rob us of all our bright future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She lay resistless in his embrace now; it was for the last
time, she thought, even if she had not been too weak to
move.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me, Editha, is there no way of escape? <em>Must</em> we
live out our dreary future, this poisoned arrow corroding
in our hearts? Ah! if this terrible tale could be refuted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it cannot, Earle; there is no way but to bear it
patiently,” she breathed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, there is no other way, for I <em>know</em> that that man is
my father, and that fact destroys our every hope. It is
hard, my beloved; let me call you so once more; let me
hold you close for the last time; let me kiss these dear
lips, and touch this shining hair, and then I will go away
as you wish. I will not add one pang to what I know
you already suffer. Heaven bless you, my weary, stricken
one—my lost love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With one strong arm he held her close against his almost
bursting heart, while with his other hand he drew back
the shining head until he could look down into the beautiful
face that he felt might perhaps be looking his very
last upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>His lips lingered upon her hair, touched her forehead with
tremulous tenderness, and then, with a sob wrung from the
depths of his soul, he pressed one long, passionate kiss upon
her lips, gently released her, stooped to pick up the ring she
had wished him to have, and then strode from the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fortnight later Earle Wayne had returned to Wycliffe
sad, almost broken-hearted, and, at twenty-five, deeming life
a burden too heavy to be borne.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXV<br> <span class='large'>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Editha Dalton and her father went to Newport—he to
get all the pleasure out of life that he could by mingling
in the sports of the gay world and spending his daughter’s
money, she to bear with what submission she could the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>weary routine in which she had no heart, and which was but
a mockery to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle had, faithful to his word, made over the long disputed
ten thousand dollars to Mr. Dalton, and this, together
with Editha’s handsome income which she tacitly
yielded up to him, enabled him to live like a prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>But people wondered to see how the brightness had faded
from the fair girl’s life.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took no interest in the pleasure and frivolities of
the fashionable watering-place.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would not attend their parties and social gatherings,
but wandered alone by the sea, or sat in seclusion of her
own room, pale, sad, and silent, thinking ever of the one so
dear, who at her bidding had put the ocean between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her rebellious heart had refused to banish him from
the place so long his own, or yield up one tithe of the
love which she had lavished upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very name of brother, applied to him, made her
shudder with repulsion, and the thought of being his sister
made her cry out with despair, and grow sick and faint
with horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton, to his credit be it said, after Earle was well
out of the way, changed his course and treated her with
great gentleness and kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps he felt a thrill of remorse as he saw her day by
day growing so frail and slight, and bearing with such sad
patience the sorrow which he had brought upon her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps, since we cannot conscientiously attribute really
unselfish motives to him, he only realized that she was
the goose who brought him the golden eggs, and considered
it a matter of policy to conciliate her favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Be this as it may, he improved his advantage to the fullest
extent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Money slipped through his fingers like water; he had
never seemed so gay, reckless, and intent upon his pleasure
before, and more than one old associate remarked that
“Mr. Dalton grew fast as he grew old.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But a Nemesis was on his track.</p>

<p class='c007'>A relentless fate was pursuing him, crying, “No quarter
until the mighty one is fallen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His days of unholy living and revenge, of treachery and
wrong, were numbered, though he knew it not, and no spirit
of warning whispered that for every evil deed he had done
he must soon give an account.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a matter of some surprise to Paul Tressalia that
Earle should return to England alone.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>He had fully expected that he would bring Editha as a
bride to Wycliffe, and he had tried to school his own heart
to bear it. He saw at once that there was some deep trouble
on his mind; no one ever had such heavy hollow eyes, such a
worn, haggard face, without some adequate cause. But,
as Earle did not offer any explanation for it, he could not
question him. And so the days went by, while he began to
mature his plans for his own future.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle at once entered upon his duties as master of Wycliffe,
and was received most heartily by all the adherents
of the former marquis, and soon gained an influence and
footing in the country which ought to have satisfied the
most exacting.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was <em>feted</em> and flattered, quoted, advised, and sought
after; but never for a moment did he forget that sad
white face that for a few minutes had lain on his breast for
the last time, nor the last heart-broken farewell and the
low-murmured “God ever bless and keep you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the time came when he had to fight another mighty
battle with himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>His hopes for the future had all been destroyed by a
single blow; but Paul Tressalia still loved Editha, he knew,
and there might be a ray of hope for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question arose within him, “Ought he not to tell
him of the change in the relations which existed between
Editha and himself, and if there was the shadow of a possibility
of his winning her love, ought he not to allow him
to put it to the test?”</p>

<p class='c007'>One day he sought him, with a pale, worn face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had conquered a mighty foe—himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>He remembered that Editha had once told him, when
speaking of her refusal of Mr. Tressalia’s offer of marriage,
that “she had never suffered more at the thought
of giving pain than she did in refusing him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one has written, “Pity melts the mind to love,” and
perchance, out of her sympathy for him, something of affection
might arise, and a life of quiet happiness be gained
for her as well as for his cousin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Paul, I have something of importance to communicate
to you,” he said, coming to the point at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say on, then; are you in trouble? Can I do anything
for you?” Mr. Tressalia asked, with an anxious glance into
the worn face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, there is nothing that you or any one else can do
for me; it is to give you a chance in the race after happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>that I come to you,” Earle answered, with something
of bitterness in his tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not understand you,” he returned, a flush rising
to his cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you still love Editha Dalton?” Earle asked, setting
his teeth to keep back a rebellious groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you need to ask me that question?” Paul Tressalia,
returned, reproachfully, his face suddenly paling now. “I
must always love her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then go and win her if you can; the way is open; there
is nothing to hinder you,” Earle said, wiping the cold sweat
from his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>His cousin looked at him in blank astonishment, wondering
if he was losing his mind that he should make such
a statement as that, or if it was some lover’s quarrel that
had driven Earle home in such despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle, without waiting for a reply, proceeded to relate
to him the story of Editha’s relationship to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is killing me,” he said, when he had finished. “I
rebel every day against the cruel fate that has separated us,
for I love her only as a man can love the woman who should
be his wife, and shall love her thus until I die. You love
her, also; and perhaps, if you can win her, you both may
yet know much of domestic peace. If I cannot conquer my
sinful heart I may die, and you will then regain what you
have lost, while Editha will, after all, be mistress of Wycliffe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, do not speak thus,” Mr. Tressalia said, with deep
emotion, for the wild bitterness and misery of his cousin
grieved him. “I was glad to relinquish Wycliffe to you
when I knew that it rightly belonged to you. I do not
covet it, and I would not have matters in this respect other
than as they are. I hope, too, that you may live to see a lusty
heir growing up to take it after you. But this is a strange
story you have told me—Editha your half-sister! Mr. Dalton
your father!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is even so, though I would gladly give every
acre of my inheritance to have it proved otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must resemble your mother’s family alone, then,
and she her mother, for there is not a single point of resemblance
between you to testify to any such relationship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know as to that. I only know that the <em>facts
exist</em> to prove it,” Earle said, dejectedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor child! she loved you so devotedly, she was so proud
of you, and she must have suffered also. I would that I
could give you both back your lost happiness. Is it not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>strange that only out of the ruin of either your hopes or
mine happiness can come to either of us?” Mr. Tressalia
said, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is ruined whether you win or not, and yet I go on
sinning day after day, loving her as madly as ever,” Earle
cried, clenching his hands in his pain. “Go, go,” he added;
“when she is once your wife, I may be able to gain something
of peace, or the semblance of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia needed no second bidding, though it must
be confessed he was not elated by any very strong hope of
success.</p>

<p class='c007'>His heart told him that if Editha loved with the same
intensity as Earle, it would be as enduring as eternity, and
he could never hope to win her as his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still he could not rest content until he had once more
put his fate to the test, and, with a tender though sad parting
from his noble-hearted kinsman, he once more crossed
the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached Newport in the height of its gayety, and was
enthusiastically welcomed by his old acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his surprise Mr. Dalton received him with great coolness,
surmising at once the errand upon which he had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had discovered, if others had not, that Paul Tressalia
was no longer “heir to great expectations,” and he was not
at all anxious now either that Editha should marry.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was ill, failing daily and hourly, as every one could
see, and many predicted a rapid decline and an early death
unless some change for the better occurred soon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton shook his head sadly and sighed heavily, as
a fond and anxious parent should do, whenever interviewed
upon the subject, but secretly he was calculating his chances
of falling heir to her snug fortune.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is my daughter,” he would say to himself, rubbing
his hands together in that peculiar way he had. “If she dies
unmarried and without a will—and I don’t think she has
thought of such a thing as that—of course, being her nearest
blood relation, I shall inherit;” and he always ended these
confidential cogitations with a chuckle, accompanied by a
look of infinite cunning.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it will be readily seen that Mr. Dalton had no idea
of encouraging Mr. Tressalia as a suitor, especially as he
could no longer offer her any peculiar advantages.</p>

<p class='c007'>But that young man was shocked at the change in the
fair girl. The laughing eyes were sad and lusterless now;
the rounded cheeks had fallen away, leaving great hollows
where before had been a delicate sea-shell bloom; the scarlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>lips, which had ever been wreathed in sunniest smiles, wore
a mournful droop, and were sad, blue, and drawn with pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>She greeted him, however, with more than her accustomed
cordiality, and listened eagerly while he told her all
about Earle and the magnificent inheritance that had fallen
to him. Any one who could tell her aught concerning her
dear one was doubly welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was never weary of hearing about Wycliffe, and all
the noble ancestors of the noble house of Vance. She took
a strange, sad pleasure in the mournful history of the unfortunate
Marion, and Paul Tressalia, seeing it, gratified her
as far as he was able, though he could but realize that he
was making no progress in her affections.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid Newport does not agree with you, Miss Dalton,”
he remarked one day, as he came upon her sitting listless
and dejected under a tree near the sea-shore, her eyes
fixed dreamily upon the restless waves, a look of pain contracting
her fair forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not enjoy Newport,” she said, with a sigh; “at
least the gay hurry and bustle that we are constantly in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why not go to some more quiet place? Why not
go to some farm among the mountains, where the air is
drier and purer? I do not like to see you looking so ill,”
he returned, with visible anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa is not content unless he can be where there is
considerable excitement,” she answered, wearily; “and I
don’t know as it matters much,” she added, with a far-away
look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It does matter,” Paul Tressalia burst forth, indignantly;
“if this air is too heavy and bracing for you, you should
not be allowed to remain here another day. Do you not
see that your health is failing? You are weaker and thinner
even than when I came, a week ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She smiled faintly, and, lifting her thin hand, held it up
between her eyes and the sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>It shone almost transparent, while every bone, vein, and
cord could be distinctly traced.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a little sign she let it drop again into her lap, and,
turning to her companion, said, with a grave, thoughtful
look on her face:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder what the spiritual body will be like?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Dalton—Editha, what made you think of that?”
he asked, startled by her words, yet knowing very well what
had made her think of it—that little hand had more of a
spiritual than a material look about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One cannot help thinking of it when the physical body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>is so frail and so easily destroyed. When one is putting
off the mortal, one naturally is curious to know what the
immortal is like;” and she spoke as calmly as if she were
merely talking of changing a dress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, you are not—you do not think you are so ill
as that?” he cried, almost awe-stricken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I hope so; what have I to live for now?” she
asked, turning her sad eyes upon him, and his heart sank
in despair within him. “You know all my trouble,” she
added, a moment after; “you know how all my hopes were
crushed. I am, as I might say, entirely alone in the world;
I have hardly a friend on whom to depend, no one to comfort
and cheer me, and I have no right even to the name
I bear. Do you think that life holds out very much that
is pleasant to me? I am young to die, and I cannot say
that I do not dread the thought of being laid away and forgotten,
and yet I know it would cure my pain—there <em>is</em>
no pain beyond, you know. If I had anything to do, if I
might be of any comfort or use to <em>any</em> one, if I had even
<em>one</em> friend who needed me, I should feel differently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sadness and hopelessness of her tone and words almost
made him weep in spite of his manhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>He threw himself down upon the grass beside her, with
a low cry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, there <em>is</em>; <em>I</em> need you; my heart has never ceased
to cry out for you; my life is miserable and aimless without
you. Come to me and comfort me, and let me try to win back
the light in your eyes, the color to your cheeks and lips,
and nurse you back to health. I do not ask, I do not <em>expect</em>,
that you can learn to love me at once as you <em>have</em> loved,
but if you will only let me take care of you, give <em>me</em> the
right to love <em>you</em> all I wish, I do believe there may be something
of peace for you yet even in this world. But I <em>cannot</em>
see you die while you are so young and bright. Be my wife,
Editha, and let me take you away from this noise and tumult
where you can regain your health, and the world will not
seem so dark to you then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young girl was seized with a violent trembling while
he was speaking; she shook and shivered with nervousness
and excitement, as if some icy blast from a snow-clad mountain
had swept down upon her, chilling her through.</p>

<p class='c007'>A bright hectic flush tinged either cheek, and her eyes,
no longer listless, glowed with a brilliancy that was almost
dazzling. Never while in perfect health had Paul Tressalia
seen her so strangely beautiful as she was at this
moment, and yet it was with a beauty that made his heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>tremble with a terrible fear. With almost the impulse of a
child, she reached out both her hands to him as he ceased
speaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he knew instinctively that it was not a gesture of
assent, though he clasped them involuntarily, and started,
to find how hot and feverish they were.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tressalia,” she said, excitedly, “I know how true
and noble you are, and I know, too, that you love me with
a deep, pure love. I know that you would be very tender
and indulgent to me, and never allow me to know a sorrow
that you could shield me from. But I cannot be your wife—I
cannot be anybody’s wife—and I should only add sin
to sin if I should grant your request, for I can never for a
moment cease to love Earle in a way that I should not. It
is that that is eating my life away—let me confess it to you,
and perhaps it will help me to bear it better. I know that
I ought to trample upon every tendril of affection that is
reaching out after him, but I cannot; my love is stronger
than I, and this constant inward warfare is fast wearing me
out. Oh, if you would simply be my friend, and let me talk
to you freely like this, and never speak to me of love again,
it would be such a comfort to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She paused a moment for breath, and then continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can trust you; I have confidence in you as I have
in no other in this land. Mr. Tressalia, <em>will</em> you be my
friend, strong and true, and <em>only that</em>, for the time that I,
may need you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was intense yearning in her look and tone. She
did need just such a friend, strong and protecting, as he
would be, if he could have the strength to endure it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could not trust her father; her heart had recoiled from
him ever since that day when so much of his evil nature had
been revealed to her, and she had no one in whom to confide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day and night her busy, excited brain went over all the
horror of that last interview with Earle, and day and night
she constantly fought the obstinate love in her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was, as she had said, wearing her life away, and if she
could but have some one in whom she could confide, it
would be a comfort to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>But could he stay in her presence, receive her confidences,
hear her daily talk of Earle and her blighted hopes, and
make no sign of his own sorrow and bitter disappointment?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be her friend, strong and true, and <em>only that</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words were like the knell of doom to him; but she
needed him. If she could relieve her heart of something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>of its burden, health might return and her life be saved.
Was not his duty clear?</p>

<p class='c007'>“And <em>never</em> anything more?” was his last appeal, as he
held her hot, trembling hands and looked into her glittering
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And never anything more,” she repeated, after him. “It
<em>cannot</em> be—<em>will</em> you not believe it?” and he knew that so it
<em>must</em> be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Back, back into his aching, almost bursting heart he
crushed his great love, with every rebellious thought, and
all the hopes that had begun to bud anew.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would do <em>anything</em> so that she need not die; he would
“trample upon every tendril of affection reaching out after
her,” as she had said regarding her love for Earle, and
become only the true and faithful friend, if by so doing he
could comfort and perchance save her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something of the struggle that this resolve cost him could
be traced in the pale but resolute face, and in his quivering
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha,” he said, solemnly, as if recording a vow, and
still clasping those small hands, “it shall be as you wish;
I will never utter another word of love to you; I will be
your steadfast friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank you!” and, like a weary, grieved child who has
restrained its sobs until it could reach the safe and tender
shelter of its mother’s arms, she dropped her head upon his
shoulder and burst into nervous weeping.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not move, he did not speak one word to stay her
tears, for he knew that they were like the refreshing rain
upon the parched and sun-baked earth, and she would be
lighter of heart and freer from pain for their flow.</p>

<p class='c007'>But who shall describe the feelings of his own tried heart
as he knelt there with that golden head resting so near it,
and from which, for her sake, he had resolved to crush relentlessly
every hope for the future?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br> <span class='large'>A NEW CHARACTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>From that day Paul Tressalia put every thought of self
aside, and devoted himself in delicate, tireless efforts to
interest and amuse the frail girl who had such entire confidence
and faith in him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>His own heart would have prompted him to go away from
all sight and sound of her, but he had promised that he
would be her “steadfast friend.” There was no particular
necessity of his returning to England at present, and, if
he could do this unhappy girl any good, he resolved to stay
and comfort her until she should need him no longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little by little he drew her away from her own sad
thoughts—at least during the day; he could not, of course,
know how she spent her nights, whether in refreshing sleep
or in sad and morbid brooding.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took her on long, delightful drives to places where,
with a dainty little lunch and a tempting book, they would
spend a few quiet hours, and then return, just weary enough
to make a rest in a comfortable corner of the broad piazza
the most enjoyable thing in the world, while he talked of a
hundred entertaining things in the twilight.</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by he ventured to invite two or three entertaining
people to go with them, and such charming little picnics
and excursions as they made! They were quiet but cultivated
people, and deeply interested in the fading girl, and
they exerted themselves in an unobtrusive way to minister
to her amusement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost unconsciously Editha was beguiled from her melancholy;
little by little the look of tense agony faded from
her face; her eyes lost their heavy, despairing look; something
of animation and interest replaced her listless, preoccupied
manner, and an occasional smile—albeit it was a
mournful one—parted her sweet lips, which gradually began
to regain something of their original color.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia was very wise in all his maneuvers; everything
he did was done without any apparent effort, everything
moved along smoothly and naturally, and, if any one
joined the party, it was brought about so quietly as to seem
almost a matter of course.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her failing appetite he managed as adroitly as he did
her wonderful heart; every day some tempting little bit
would find its way to her room—where, owing to her health,
she took her meals—just at dinner-time. It was never much
at a time, just enough, and served so attractively as to make
her taste, and tasting was followed by a desire to eat the
whole, and then she involuntarily found herself wishing he
had sent a little more.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this way she was not surfeited with anything, but a
natural craving for food was gradually created, until she
found herself able to eat quite a respectable meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day they went, as they often did, to Truro Park.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Mr. Tressalia had found a cozy, retired rock, where they
could sit, and talk, and read without fear of being disturbed,
and see without being seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day was delightful, and had tempted many people
abroad, and the park was filled with gay visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, reclining on a soft shawl which Mr. Tressalia
had spread over a moss-covered rock, was the picture of
comfort as she listened to her companion’s rich voice as
he read from a new and interesting book, while her face
involuntarily lighted as she caught the sound of merry laughter
and children’s happy voices in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found herself wondering if she could be the same
miserable creature that she had been three weeks before.</p>

<p class='c007'>A feeling of peace was stealing over her, a sense of care
and protection surrounded her, and she knew that health
and strength were gradually returning to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart was still wounded and sore—it could not be
otherwise; but there was not quite the intolerable burden
crushing her that there had been before the coming of her
kind friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia closed his book at last, and a look of satisfaction
stole into his eye as he marked her look of interest,
and the faint tinge of color that for the first time he saw
in her cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>He drew from his pocket a silver fruit-knife, and, reaching
for a tiny basket that he had brought with him, but
had kept tantalizingly covered all the time, he exposed to
view two of the largest and most luscious peaches imaginable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, when you have eaten one of these as an appetizer,
we will return for our dinner,” he said, with a smile,
as he deftly extracted the stone from the crimson and yellow
fruit, and, placing the two halves on a large grape-leaf, laid
it in her lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is too beautiful to eat,” Editha said, viewing it with
admiring eyes; but she disposed of it with evident relish,
nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other was prepared in the same way, and ready for
her as the last mouthful disappeared, but she demurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have not had your share,” she said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are my patient, remember, and I shall prescribe
for you as I judge best; but if you feel very sensitive
about it, I will share with you this time;” and, while he
ate one-half, he watched the other disappear with intense
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Editha could not fail to improve if her appetite could
be coaxed back in this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>They arose to return to their hotel, and, as they left their
cozy retreat, they saw approaching them a lady leaning upon
the arm of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were both distinguished looking, and instantly attracted
the attention of Editha and her attendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they drew nearer, Mr. Tressalia started and uttered a
low exclamation; the next instant he smiled, lifted his hat
with a low bow, and, returning his salutation, they passed on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia would have stopped and greeted them, but
he knew how shy Editha was of strangers in her weak state,
and he did not deem it best.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, in her one passing glance, had instantly been attracted
by the tall, queenly woman, who might perhaps have
been about forty-two or three years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face was fair, and sweet, and beautiful as a picture,
and was surrounded by soft, waving chestnut hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes were large and blue, but rather mournful in
expression, while there was a grieved droop about the full,
handsome mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her companion was a middle-aged gentleman, though
somewhat older than the lady, and, from their resemblance
to each other, Editha judged them to be brother and sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There goes a woman with a history, and a sad one,
too,” Mr. Tressalia remarked, when they were beyond hearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha sighed and wondered how many women there
were in the world who had sad histories, but she only said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are acquaintances of yours, then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; the lady is called Madam Sylvester, though I have
been told that it is not her real name, being her maiden
name, resumed after some unpleasantness connected with an
unfortunate marriage. I met her in Paris two winters ago,
and I think I never saw a more charming woman of her
age in my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is certainly very pleasant to look at, though she
shows that she has known sorrow of some kind,” Editha
said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you like to know her history—at least as much
of it as I am able to tell you? It is quite interesting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Report says that when quite young she fell in love with
her own cousin and became engaged to him. This was a
secret between them, since the lover was not in a position
to marry. He went to sea to seek his fortune, as the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>goes, and not long after was reported lost. Miss Sylvester,
to hide her grief, immediately plunged into all sorts of
gayety and dissipation, and only a few months after her
lover’s death met a young American, who was instantly
attracted by her great beauty. He soon made her an offer
of marriage, and, after a very short courtship, they were
married. A year later the former lover suddenly turned
up—he was not lost, though had been nearly drowned, and
afterward lay a long time in a fever. The young wife, in
her joy at seeing him once more, thoughtlessly betrayed her
love for him, which even then was not dead. The husband
grew furious and unreasonably jealous, charged her with
wilfully deceiving him, and a hot and angry scene followed.
The next day the wife was missing—‘she had fled,’ those who
knew anything of the circumstances said, ‘with her early
lover.’ She returned almost immediately, however, humbled
and repentant; but her husband denounced her, although
she swore that she had committed no wrong. He returned
to America; she hid herself broken-hearted for awhile, but
finally sought her brother, whom she convinced of her
chastity, since which time, having no other friends, they have
seemed to live for each other. She would never consent
to be called by her husband’s name after that—though I
never heard what that was—but took her maiden name.
She is a wonderful woman, however; her life has been
devoted to doing good; she is chastity itself, and is beloved
by everybody who knows her, while her sympathy for the
erring is boundless. That is an outline of her history, or
as much as I know of it; but I believe there are some self-righteous
people who shun her on account of what they
term her ‘early sin,’ but the majority revere her, while I
must confess to a feeling of great admiration for her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What became of the young lover with whom it was supposed
she fled?” Editha asked, deeply interested in the sad
tale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know—I never heard. Madam never speaks of
her past, and that is a mystery to the curious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should like to know her,” Editha said, feeling strangely
drawn toward one who, like herself, had suffered so much.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you? That is easily managed. I will ascertain
where she is stopping, call upon her, and, as her heart
is always touched for the sick, I know she will gladly come
and see you,” Mr. Tressalia said, eagerly, exceedingly pleased
to have Editha manifest so much interest in his friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. I should like it if she would; her history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>is very sad, and her face attracts me strangely,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days afterwards they were in the Redwood Library,
examining some of the valuable manuscripts on exhibition
there, when Madam Sylvester and her brother entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia had tried to ascertain where they were stopping,
but, to his great disappointment, he had failed to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>He now went forward at once to greet them, and they
seemed very much pleased to renew their acquaintance with
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After chatting a few moments, he brought Editha to
madam and introduced her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She studied the sweet face for a moment, then her faultlessly
gloved hand closed over Editha’s fingers in a strong
yet tender clasp of sympathy and friendliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had read in the pale, sorrow-lined face a grief kindred
to what she, too, had suffered in the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not well, my dear,” she said, with a wistful
look into the sad blue eyes, still keeping her hand closely
clasped in hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Dalton has not been well, but we hope she is on
the gain a little now. Have you seen the new piece of
statuary that was brought in yesterday?” Mr. Tressalia
asked, to draw her attention from Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was quite sensitive about having her illness remarked
by strangers, and the color was now creeping with painful
heat into her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam took the hint at once, and turned to look at the
new statue, and for a while kept up a spirited conversation
with Mr. Tressalia about the objects of general interest in
Newport.</p>

<p class='c007'>But ever and anon her eyes sought the fair face bending
with curious interest over the manuscripts with a look of
pity and tenderness that told she was deeply interested in
the frail-looking stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is she? Some one in whom you are <em>particularly</em>
interested?” she asked, with the privilege of an old friend,
as she drew Paul still farther away, ostensibly to look at
some pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'>He started, and his noble face was clouded with pain as
he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I am particularly interested in her, but not in the
way you mean, for her heart belongs to another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! I thought from appearances that she belonged, or
would some day, belong to you,” returned madam, with a
keen look into his handsome face.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“No,” he said, gravely; “I am simply her friend. She
has recently met with a great sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew it,” madam replied, with a soft glance at Editha,
and a slight trembling of her lips. “Has the dear child a
mother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; her mother died some years ago. She has no relatives
living excepting her father, and he is not in sympathy
with her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! how I would like to comfort her. Come and see
me this evening, and tell me more about her. I am strangely
attracted toward her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia promised, and then they went back to
Editha. Madam monopolized her, while he entertained her
brother, and it was not long before the fair girl’s heart was
completely won by the beautiful and tender-hearted woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam Sylvester was remarkable for her tact and great
versatility of talents, not the least of which was her charming
manner in conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could be grave or gay, witty or learned, and fascinating
in any role.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia regarded her in surprise while she talked
with Editha, drawing her from one subject to another,
until she made her forget that there was such a person in
the world as poor, heart-broken Editha Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>She won the smiles back to her lips, drove the lines of
care and trouble from her brow, and once, as she related
some droll incident that had occurred on the steamer in
which she came over, made her laugh aloud—the old-timed,
clear, sweet laugh, that made Paul’s heart thrill with delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Dalton, I am coming to see you. I am a dear lover
of young people,” she said, as they began to talk of going.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do; I shall be delighted,” Editha said, with a sudden
lighting of her sad eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am a stranger here in Newport, never having been
in this country before,” madam continued. “I wish you and
Mr. Tressalia would take pity upon me, and give me the
benefit of your familiarity with the objects of interest here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha unhesitatingly promised, not even suspecting that
this request was made more for her own sake than for the
beautiful stranger’s; and then they all left the library together.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they were about entering their carriage, Mr. Dalton
drove by in his sporting sulky.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed to Editha, and then bestowed a passing glance
upon her new acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c007'>That glance made him start and bestow a more searching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>look upon Madam Sylvester; then he grew a sudden
and deep crimson, while a look of great anxiety settled on
his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned and looked back again after he had driven by.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There can be but one face like that in the world. I must
look into this,” he muttered, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who was that lady and gentleman with whom I saw
you to-day at the Redwood Library?” he asked of Editha
that evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A Mrs. Sylvester and her brother,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Mrs. Sylvester!</em>” repeated Mr. Dalton, with a slight emphasis
on the title.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tressalia introduced her as Madam Sylvester. Do
you know anything about her?” she asked, looking up in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! Mr. Tressalia knows her, then? Where is she
from?” he returned, thoughtfully, and not heeding her question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From Paris, France; they are French people, and extremely
agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton’s face lost something of its habitual glow at
this information, and he appeared ill at ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Um! strangers, then, here. Does Tressalia know them
intimately?” and he shot a searching, anxious glance at his
daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he was telling me something of madam’s history a
day or two ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! have they been here any length of time?” interrupted
Mr. Dalton, with a frown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Less than a week, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes; go on with what you were going to tell me,”
he again interrupted, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He said madam had seen a great deal of trouble—there
was some misunderstanding between herself and husband,
who, by the way, was an American, which resulted in their
separation after they had been married only a year. But
she appears like a very lovely woman to me,” Editha replied,
with a dreary look, as she remembered how she had been
drawn toward the beautiful stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton watched her keenly out of the corners of his
eyes; he was exceedingly moved and nervous about something;
the corners of his mouth twitched convulsively, while
he kept clasping and unclasping his hands in an excited way.</p>

<p class='c007'>He paced the floor in silence for a few moments, then
abruptly left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Half an hour after he returned, and, while pretending to
look over the newspaper, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, I’ve about concluded that I’d like a look at Saratoga;
it is just the height of the season now; everything
will be lovely, and Newport is getting a little tame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tame, papa! Why, I thought there was no place like
Newport to you!” she exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know; Newport is a sort of summer home to me,
and, of course, there is no place like home; but, if you
do not mind, I’d like a change for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cannot you go without me? I am very comfortable
here,” Editha asked, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had no heart for gayety, and she was really happier
just now there at Newport—notwithstanding her assertion
to Mr. Tressalia that she did not enjoy Newport—than she
had ever hoped to be again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed,” he returned, quickly and decidedly. “I
could not think of leaving you alone while you are so
delicate; and besides, I cannot spare you, Editha—you and
I are rather alone in this busy world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked up in surprise at him at this unusual remark.
It was a very rare occurrence for him to address her in
such an affectionate manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>It almost seemed to her, with the distrust she had lately
had of him, that there was some sinister motive prompting
this sudden change; but she stifled the feeling, and
answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, I will go to Saratoga if you like. When
do you wish to start?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-morrow, if you can arrange it,” Mr. Dalton replied,
the cloud lifting from his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I can arrange it;” but she sighed as she said it,
for she was really beginning to wake up to a little life, and
she dreaded any change.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been so calmly content since she had come to
a definite understanding with Mr. Tressalia, and she wondered,
with a feeling of sadness stealing over her, what she
should do without her tireless friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had grown to depend upon him for amusement; besides,
he heard regularly from Earle, and though she did
not dare acknowledge it even to her own heart, yet those
letters from over the sea were the great events of the week
to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was sorry to go away without becoming more intimately
acquainted with Madam Sylvester, for she had been
strangely drawn toward her, thinking almost constantly of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>her and her charming ways ever since her introduction to
her. All during the evening she kept hoping that Mr. Tressalia
would drop in, that she might tell him of the change
in their plans, half wishing that he would join himself
to their party and accompany them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he was spending the evening with Madam Sylvester,
and meant to see Editha as early as possible the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in this he was disappointed, for a gentleman friend
sought him to give his advice upon the merits of a horse
that he was contemplating buying, and before the bargain
was completed Editha was gone, without even a word of
good-by.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br> <span class='large'>A CHANGE OF SCENE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was two o’clock in the afternoon when at length Paul
Tressalia knocked upon Editha’s parlor door.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was opened by the chambermaid, of whom he inquired
for Miss Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is gone, sir,” was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone! Where?” he exclaimed, infinitely surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know, sir; they left on the noon boat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did they leave no word—no message for me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; Miss Dalton left a note,” the girl answered,
producing it from the depths of her pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul eagerly tore it open and devoured its contents:</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Friend</span>:—Papa has suddenly decided that Newport
is ‘tame,’ and longs for Saratoga. We are to leave on the
twelve-o’clock boat, and do not know when we shall return.
I shall not soon forget the days you have made so pleasant
for me, nor the great good your cheerful society has done
me. I would rather stay than go, but think it best to yield
to papa’s wishes. I hoped to see you before we left, but
suppose you were engaged. Please give my kind remembrances
to Madam Sylvester. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir.</span></i></p>

<div class='lg-container-r c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Editha.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“What in the name of Jupiter can have made him take
this sudden start?” Paul Tressalia muttered, with a clouded
brow, as with a terrible feeling of loneliness he sought his
own rooms. “Can anything have transpired to upset his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>equilibrium?” he continued. “It must have been a <em>very</em> sudden
start, for I do not believe he contemplated any such thing
yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He sat a long time thinking the matter over, and longing
to follow them immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew Editha would miss his care and attention, while
as for him, it seemed as if the sun had suddenly been put out
of existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton had not treated him with his usual politeness
this summer, and he was not sure but that he had done
this purposely, in order to remove Editha from his society,
and, if that was the case, he doubted the propriety of
going after them.</p>

<p class='c007'>These reflections were interrupted by the entrance of a
servant, who brought him a card.</p>

<p class='c007'>It proved to be that of Madam Sylvester, and he immediately
went down to the reception-room, taking with him
the note Editha had written.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why that brow of gloom, my friend? You look as
if you had met with some sudden and great disappointment,”
madam said, playfully, after they had exchanged greetings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so I have. I have just learned that Miss Dalton and
her father have gone to Saratoga; and the suddenness of the
movement disturbs and perplexes me exceedingly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone! Now <em>I</em> am dismayed, for I had come to call and
be introduced to Papa Dalton, and ask him to spare his
charming daughter to me for a few days. We are going
to join a party to the White Mountains, and I thought if
I could tempt Miss Dalton to accompany us, the change
would do her good,” madam said, with regret.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would have been beneficial to her, and it was very
thoughtful in you to remember her,” replied Mr. Tressalia,
much pleased at this attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not give me any credit for what is pure selfishness
on my part,” madam said, laughing. “I am over head and
ears in love, as they say here, with your lovely little friend,
and I wanted her under the shadow of my own wing for
awhile to get better acquainted with her;” and the lady’s
face was very wistful, notwithstanding her playful speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot understand their sudden flight—for such it seems
to me,” returned Mr. Tressalia, moodily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you did not know anything of their intention?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a breath, until about half an hour ago, when I
knocked at Miss Dalton’s door, and the chambermaid gave
me this note;” and he handed it to her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“What a pretty hand she writes,” said madam, smiling,
as she noted the delicate chirography upon the perfumed
envelope.</p>

<p class='c007'>She read it through, growing grave as she marked the
regret the note expressed at being obliged to go away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes lighted with tenderness at the mention of herself,
but she started as if in sudden pain, her fair face flushing
a vivid crimson, as she read and involuntarily repeated
the name signed at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha! Mr. Tressalia, you never told me what your
friend’s name is,” and he thought her lips quivered slightly,
as if at the remembrance of some sad incident of the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I usually call her Miss Dalton when speaking of
her to others. It is the dearest name in the world to me,”
he added, with a slight huskiness in his voice, “though I
never utter it without pain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i><span lang="la">Et tu</span></i>,” madam said, softly, noting the pain in his face,
and knew all about it at once. “I thought you said——”
she began again, and then suddenly stopped, as if she were
trespassing upon forbidden ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know to what you refer,” he replied. “I thought when
you asked me if I was ‘particularly interested’ in her that
you meant to infer an engagement between us, but—I may
as well confess it—I have loved her hopelessly for two
years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam sighed heavily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why is it that the world always goes wrong for some
people?” he asked, passionately, and longing for sympathy
now that he had begun to unburden his heart, and realizing,
also that now Editha was gone, Newport was a blank
to him, and fearing that his boasted “friendship” had not
been so disinterested after all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, why, unless to fit us for something better than
earth’s fleeting pleasures? There are some people in the
world who would never own allegiance to the Great King,
if they were not driven to Him by sorrow. It were better
to suffer a few years here than to miss the bright Forever,”
madam, said, musingly, and as if talking with herself rather
than to him. “But,” she added, shaking off her dreaminess,
“tell me more of this beautiful girl and your unfortunate
regard for her—I am an old and privileged friend, you know,
and the name ‘Editha’ has a charm for me which will only
cease when I cease to live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia, glad to have so sweet a confidante, related
all the story of his love for the fair girl, his disappointment
on learning of her affection for Earle Wayne,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>his hasty summons home to take possession of his supposed
inheritance, which lost half its charm when he knew
that Editha could not become its mistress and his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>He told her how he had been obliged to resign Wycliffe
to Earle, who also hoped to make Miss Dalton mistress
there, and who had returned so full of joy and hope to
claim her as his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came the story of her strange abduction, her release
from her captor’s power by her lover, and then, when they
believed their trials were all at an end, the dreadful blow
came which had nearly broken both their hearts, and had
seemed likely to wear Editha into her grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a sad, wonderful story it is. And you, I suppose,
after the discovery which had ruined the life of your
cousin, came thither to test your fate again?” madam said,
her eyes beaming gentlest of sympathy upon the rejected
lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but I might have known better,” he answered, bitterly,
and with a sigh that was almost a sob heaving his
broad chest. “I might have known that a love like hers,
so pure, so strong, and noble, could never be won by another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Truly things do seem to go wrong sometimes in this
world,” madam said, sadly, and thinking of the poor sweet
child who had passed through such deep water. Then, suddenly
looking up at her companion with a keen glance, she
continued: “You have suffered, my friend, deeply—you suffer
now, even though you strive so nobly to overcome it; but—would
you deem me very unsympathetic if I should tell you
that I believe it will be better for you, after all, not to have
married Editha Dalton, even though she could have given her
wounded heart into your keeping?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia regarded her with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should you say that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is not exactly fitted for you—you might have passed
a quiet, peaceful life together, but you could not have met
all the wants of her nature, nor she of yours. You are
maturer for your years than she is for hers, and beautiful,
talented, lovable though she may be, there would have come
a time in your lives when you both would have discovered
there was something wanting to fill out the measure of
your happiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You speak like a prophetess,” Paul Tressalia said, with a
sad, skeptical smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not lived my lonely life for naught,” she answered,
with a sigh. “I have studied human nature in all
its phases, and, from what I know of you, I feel that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>woman whom you should marry should be quiet and self-contained
like yourself, with a little touch of sorrow in
her life to mate your own, and nearer your age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall never marry,” he said, with a pale and suffering
face, and yet wondering at his companion’s strange words,
while somehow his thoughts involuntarily took a swift flight,
and he saw in the quiet parlor of a vine-clad gothic villa
a gentle woman, with a sweet though sad face, which, next
to Editha Dalton’s, he had once told himself was the most
beautiful his eyes had ever rested upon, while her voice,
with its plaintive music, had vibrated upon his heart as the
gentle summer breeze vibrates upon the strings of an æolian
harp.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had called it sympathy then. Would the mystic future,
as it drew on apace, gradually efface this bitter pain from
his heart, and he find beneath it a new name written there?</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may think so now, but believe me, Paul, my friend,
you will find her yet—this gentle, beautiful woman whom you
should marry,” madam said, in reply to his remark about not
marrying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear madam,” he returned, with a smile and a shake
of his head, “you are but building castles in the air, which
the lightest breath will dissipate. A man can never love
but once as I have loved Editha Dalton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That may be true,” madam smilingly assented; “but the
first fierce, wild passion may not always be the wisest love.
Wait a little, <i><span lang="fr">mon ami</span></i>, and we shall see. You know—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘No one is so accursed by fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>No one so utterly desolate,</div>
      <div class='line'>But some heart, though unknown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Responds unto his own.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But, meantime, I have a strange, irrepressible longing to
see more of this motherless girl, whose life has been so
sadly blighted at the outset. Mr. Tressalia, I think <em>I</em> would
like to see a little of Saratoga myself, and I feel confident
that Miss Editha would not feel sorry to see her friend
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think so?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure of it. This little note breathes of a strong
regret that she was obliged to go away at all. I am afraid
she will wilt again if she cannot be under genial influences.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam’s face was full of a strange, wistful tenderness
as she spoke, and Paul Tressalia wondered why she should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>feel so strangely drawn toward Editha. It was a matter
of wonder to all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does that mean that you think we had better follow
Mr. Dalton and his daughter to Saratoga?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but first I must go to the White Mountains, since
I proposed the trip, and others would be disappointed if it
was given up. I must postpone my trip to Saratoga until
my return,” returned madam, with a look which plainly said
she wished she had not planned the trip to the mountains at
all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder——” Paul began, and then stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well? And so do I,” laughed his companion, after waiting
a moment and he did not go on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was pondering the question whether it is best for me to
go to Saratoga at all,” he said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Editha is really on the gain, it would perhaps be
better for me to return at once to England and not see her
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does it hurt you so, my friend?” asked madam, pityingly.
“You must conquer that, if possible, though I myself
know how hard a thing that is to do, and it seems cold
advice to give. But it would give me pleasure if you would
accompany us to Saratoga. We know nothing about the
ins and outs of the place, and it would really be a comfort
to have a pilot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then that settles the matter. I will go with you,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if it is to interfere with any necessary business,”
madam said, hastily, yet decidedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will not. I have no business—I have no aim in life
now,” he added, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come with us to the mountains,” Madam Sylvester said,
with a sudden thought. “You need a little judicious comforting
as well as Miss Dalton, and I believe I am just
the one to take you in hand. Will you come?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, thanks; I cannot resist. I believe you charm every
one with whom you come in contact,” he answered, laughing,
and glad to be invited.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is pleasant to hear. We will make our trip as short
as possible, and then fly to the far-famed springs of Saratoga,
to drink of their mystic waters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And so it was arranged, and Paul Tressalia was drawn
irresistibly to do this woman’s bidding, yet wondering at
himself for doing it, and more and more surprised to see
how Editha had fascinated her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>But he could not know how rapidly an invisible hand
was turning the pages of life, and that he was soon to read
a strange story in that mystic book of fate, which Heaven
so seldom deigns to open to mortal eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br> <span class='large'>AT SARATOGA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Madam Sylvester went to the White Mountains with her
party, as she had planned to do, while Mr. Dalton, congratulating
himself upon the success of his maneuver—the
reason for which he supposed no one but himself knew anything
about—was enjoying the brilliant society at Saratoga
to the full.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I flatter myself that I have played my little game very
nicely,” he said many times to himself, when thinking of
their hasty flitting from Newport; and those soft white
hands of his were rubbed together in the most approving
manner, accompanied by a most approving chuckle.</p>

<p class='c007'>He insisted now that Editha was well enough to join in
the gayeties of the place and accompany him to the different
places of amusement and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would have preferred the solitude of her own room
or to be allowed to roam quietly by herself in the different
parks during the morning, when there were few abroad;
but he persisted, and, thinking it could not matter much
what she did, she yielded for the sake of peace, although
she did not really feel able to bear the excitement as yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result was highly gratifying to Mr. Dalton, for Editha
at once became a star of no small magnitude. Her delicate,
almost ethereal beauty instantly attracted a crowd of admirers.
She was “new,” and after an entirely different
pattern from most of the fashionable belles who frequented
the place, which, together with the fact of her being an
heiress, was considered sufficient cause for any amount
of admiration and homage being paid her. And so she
was whirled into the vortex of fashionable life. The days
were turned into night, night into day, and all the quiet
which she had so enjoyed at Newport into an endless round
of excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening there was to be a garden-party—“the most
brilliant affair of the season,” according to the flaming announcement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Editha did not want to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am tired out now, papa, besides having no heart for
anything of the kind,” she said, wearily, when Mr. Dalton
began to talk of the details of her dress, about which he was
very particular for a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw!” he returned, impatiently; “you have been moping
yourself to death, and need waking up. This is to
be the finest occasion of the season, I am told, and I shall
take no pleasure in it unless I can have you with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not Editha that he particularly wanted for the
sake of the pleasure he would take in her society, but a
handsomely dressed lady by his side, to be admired, and
to help him pass the time agreeably.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course Editha yielded rather than to have any words
about it, and gave her attention, with what interest she
could command, to the wearisome business of preparation.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the night arrived, and she appeared before her
father in the finest of black Brussels net, embroidered in
rich golden-hearted daisies, and gracefully looped over rose-colored
silk, from which here and there flashed superb ornaments
of diamonds, and above which her delicate face rose
like some pure, clear-cut cameo, Mr. Dalton was for a
moment speechless with admiration, and Editha really felt
paid for the effort she had made.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha,” exclaimed her father, when he at last found
his voice, “there will be no one so beautiful as yourself in
the park to-night. I shall have the honor of escorting the
fairest woman in Saratoga.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, papa. I never heard you compliment any
one like that before,” laughed Editha, surprised at his enthusiasm,
and never realizing how exceedingly lovely she
was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never had occasion, I can assure you,” he answered,
as his eyes lingered proudly upon her graceful form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was not one of those variable young ladies who
adopt every new fashion for dressing the hair, whether it is
becoming or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her hair to-night, as always, was worn in plaited bands
of satin smoothness, and coiled around her shapely head, its
only ornament a small cluster of daisies fastened on one side
with a diamond aigrette.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tiny daisies, in the center of whose golden heart there
glittered a diamond like a drop of dew, hung in her ears,
while on her arms of Parian whiteness were bracelets to
match.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would indeed be impossible to imagine a fairer vision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>or a more unique and attractive costume among the hundreds
that would assemble that evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weather was perfect, and the decorations of the park
were very elaborate and elegant. Flags hung gracefully
canopied over the entrance like curtains, and festooned
along the fanciful frame-work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Light frames of stars, triangles, hearts, shields, and many
other devices, were fastened everywhere among the trees to
support the transparent lanterns of almost magical beauty.
The electric light flooded the whole scene with almost the
brightness of day, and made the place seem as if touched
by the wand of an enchanter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The finest dressing of the season graced this party, and,
as some one has said, “it did not require a great stretch
of the imagination to convert the passing throng into elves
and fairies, their raiment appearing to have been woven
with the gossamer threads of the cobwebs, and out of the
butterflies’ wings, as if the dew of the morning, the mist
of the moon, the dew-drops gathered from the calyx of
the lily, had all been collected and laid with homage at
the feet of the ethereal creatures who lead captive the sons
of men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And that the fairest of them all was Editha Dalton seemed
to be generally admitted by both old and young.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strangers, catching sight of that fair face rising above
the golden-hearted daisies, pointed her out, and asked who
she was. Friends and acquaintances crowded around to
catch a word, a smile, a look even, and wondering why they
had never before realized how exquisitely lovely she was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something of the beauty and excitement of the occasion
seemed to animate her. Her burden of sorrow for the time
seemed to drop from her heart, and she appeared to become
a part of the brightness which surrounded her, while she
danced, chatted, and laughed much like the free-hearted,
blithesome Editha of old.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many remarked it afterward, and declared that she must
have been a fairy, or elf, who, since they never saw her
again, must have floated away at some magic hour of the
night at the stern decree of some uncanny ogre. Nor
were they far out of the way in their surmises.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small hours were approaching, and the merriment
was at its height. Editha had been dancing with a friend
of Mr. Dalton’s, and seemed to enjoy it, as much as any
one. She evidently liked her companion, for she made herself
very agreeable to him, while he more than once, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>his wit and sparkling repartee, had called the familiar silvery
laughter from her beautiful lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the dance was through he led her to a quiet place
to rest. He did not leave her, but remained standing by
her side, watching her expressive face, as she in turn
watched the passing throng, forgetful for the time of all
save the life and joy of the occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he saw her start. A flush leaped into her cheeks,
a brighter light to her eyes, as she arose and extended both
hands to a gentleman who was approaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tressalia! How glad I am! When did you arrive,
and how did you find me?” she asked, all in a breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. I arrived on the late evening train, and
I found you by the power of intuition, I think,” he answered,
laughing, as he glanced from her to her companion,
and heartily shook both hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha introduced the two gentlemen, and, after a few
moments’ conversation, her former companion excused himself
and went away with a clouded brow, muttering something
about the unexpected appearance of old lovers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was really delighted to see her friend. She had
missed him sadly, and she was chatting away with him in
the most social manner, asking all sorts of questions about
Newport and her friends, when Mr. Dalton all at once
came upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>He expressed no surprise at seeing Mr. Tressalia, but
the frown upon his brow testified to his displeasure, although
he politely inquired regarding his arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came on with some old friends who were anxious to
visit the place—Madam Sylvester and her brother,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton started violently, and flushed hotly at this
information, and appeared all at once so nervous and
strangely excited that Mr. Tressalia regarded him with surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madam Sylvester!” exclaimed Editha, joyously, and not
noticing her father’s agitation. “I am so glad. I liked her
so much at Newport. I shall be glad to extend our acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your pleasure is reciprocated, I can assure you, for
madam was equally delighted with you,” Paul returned, with
his eyes still on Mr. Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had withdrawn a trifle within the shadow of a tree,
and stood with his head bent, looking down upon the ground,
his face dark with anger, while he worked his hands in a
nervous way and gnawed his under lip.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“What in thunder ails the man, to make him look and
act so strangely?” the young man asked, within himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are madam and her brother here at the garden-party?”
Editha asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; the fame of it reached us before we arrived, and
you know the electric light is visible for several miles before
we reach Saratoga; so, notwithstanding our weariness,
we all thought we must come and take a look at the enchanted
place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is lovely, isn’t it?” she asked, her eyes roving in every
direction over the bright scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed; I never saw anything like it before. Madam
and her brother went to the dancing pavilion to see if they
could find you, but I thought I should discover you in some
quiet nook, as I have.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha laughed, and the beautiful color rushed half guiltily
to her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would not have thought so if you had come fifteen
minutes earlier. I think the music has bewildered me to-night
for I have been dancing with the merriest. But how
does it happen that you are a visitor at Saratoga?” she
asked, to change the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, after receiving your note telling me of your destination,
Newport lost its charms, and I felt in immediate
need of medicinal spring water,” he said, in a playful strain,
delighted to find her so improved and animated. “Madam
Sylvester was affected in the same way,” he added. “I
expect that remarkable woman will be tempted to kidnap
you and bear you away to regions unknown before long, she
has taken such a fancy to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just hear that, papa—fancy any one taking such a liking
to me that they would want to kidnap me. Why, what is the
matter? Are you ill?” Editha cried, as she turned toward
her father, and was transfixed by one glance into his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was white as alabaster, and his eyes glowed like two
coals of fire with some violent inward emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no; not ill, but very tired. I think we ought to
return at once to our hotel, Editha,” he answered, with an
evident effort to regain his composure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry if you are tired, papa; I thought you were
enjoying yourself immensely. Sit down and rest in some
quiet place, please. I really do not like to return just
yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you are not strong; I fear the dampness will do
you injury,” Mr. Dalton said, anxious to get her away at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>once, and never having given a thought to the dampness
until that moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very warm and comfortable; indeed I thought the
air remarkably clear and dry to-night,” Editha said, without
moving.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, Editha, I think I must insist——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please don’t insist upon anything, papa,” returned the
girl, wilfully; “if you are so weary, go <em>you</em> back to the
Grand Union, and Mr. Tressalia will bring me by and by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was determined that she would not be walked off
thus summarily like a little girl in petticoats, and Mr. Dalton
had to beat a retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I will go for a smoke, then,” he said, as he
turned and walked abruptly away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Tressalia wondered what it all meant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man had betrayed his great agitation only upon the
mention of Madam Sylvester’s name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did he know her, and if so was there enmity between
them? Was that the reason of his sudden flight from Newport?</p>

<p class='c007'>His manner was certainly very strange, and he had evidently
intended to get Editha away before any meeting occurred
between her and madam, but he could not very well
urge the matter any further without betraying himself, and
so he had walked away in no enviable frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha watched him curiously until he passed from sight,
then turning to her companion, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe papa is feeling very well; perhaps I
ought to have gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall I take you to him?” Paul asked, considerately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not just yet. I would like to see Madam Sylvester a
moment, if we can find her; but first tell me”—and the
beautiful face instantly lost all its lovely color—“have you
heard again from—from—Earle?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I had a letter day before yesterday, and he is not
very well, he writes; the doctor does not think the climate
exactly agrees with him,” Mr. Tressalia answered, his own
face growing grave as he saw the brightness die out of
hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha sighed, and the old grieved look returned to her
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you like to read his letter? I have it with me,”
he asked, considerately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no; I could not do that. Tell me, please, what
you like about him; but I cannot quite bear to read his
own words just yet,” she said, with unutterable sadness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“My poor little friend, your lot is a hard one,” he said,
softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t pity me, please—life is hard enough for us all, I
think,” she returned, quickly and bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle thinks he will have to have a change as soon as
he can get away,” Mr. Tressalia continued, “and asks if I
will resume the charge of Wycliffe for him. Shall I tell
you all that he says about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes; go on,” the poor girl said, eagerly, though
every word was fresh torture to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He says he cannot live longer away from you, Editha;
it is killing him, and he <em>must</em> come where he can see you
once in awhile. He writes, ‘Ask her if I may. I will say
nothing that shall wound her. I will be firm and strong;
but, oh! I am so homesick for a look into her eyes, for a
clasp of her hand. Ask her, Paul, if I may come.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, <em>no</em>, <span class='fss'>NO</span>!” burst in a low, frightened tone from the
girl’s lips. “He must not come. Write to him instantly
and tell him so. Mr. Tressalia, I could not bear that of all
things in the world. I will not see him. He must not come.
I will hide from him. Oh! why must I suffer so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words ended in a low, heart-broken sob. She had
clasped both hands convulsively around her companion’s arm
in her excitement, and was now shivering and trembling so
that he was greatly alarmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brightness and exceeding beauty that had been hers
when he first saw her had only been the result of a momentary
excitement after all.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had flattered himself that she was really better and
stronger, both in body and spirit, but now he saw that her
poor heart was just as sore and wounded as ever, and that
her fatal love was still eating at her vitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle, he knew from the letter he had so lately received,
was suffering in the same way, and what these poor tried
ones were to do all their future was a sore trouble to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be calm, dear child,” he said, in low, quiet tones. “Earle
shall do just as you wish. Come and walk with me until
your nerves are a little more steady.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He unclasped those locked fingers from his arm, and drawing
one hand within it, led her away into a retired path, and
talked gravely of other things, until he saw the wild look
fade from her eyes, the hand on his arm grow quiet, and
knew that her intense excitement was gradually subsiding.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it hurt him deeply to hear every few minutes a deep,
shuddering, sobbing sigh come from her pale lips—something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>as a child breathes after it has exhausted itself with
weeping and fallen asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would gladly have restored happiness both to Earle
and her if he could have done so, even to the sacrificing
of his own life, but he could not—each must bear his own
burden. It seemed as if they had been beset on every hand
with troubles during the past few years, fulfilling those
words of Shakespeare’s:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When sorrows come, they come not single spies,</div>
      <div class='line'>But in battalions.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Earle has had an adventure. Shall I tell you about it?”
he asked, when at length she had apparently grown quite
calm, and intuitively knowing that she would like to hear
more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There has been an attempt made to rob Wycliffe, and
but for his calmness and bravery great mischief would
have been done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! he was always brave; but—but I hope he was
not injured,” Editha cried, a feeling of faintness stealing
over her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless you, no; else he would not now be talking of a
change. He not only prevented a robbery and protected
himself, but he has captured the robber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure that is good news,” she said, now deeply interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, Editha, who do you suppose the robber proved to
be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure I cannot imagine; and yet you—you cannot
mean——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I do mean it,” he answered, reading her thought.
“It was no other than that wretch who robbed your father’s
house several years ago, and for whom Earle suffered the
penalty. It was <em>Tom Drake</em>, that man whom you met after
your visit to John Loker’s, and who afterwards entered
your house the second time and compelled you by his mesmeric
power to go away with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha shuddered, and yet she could hardly believe her
ears. She had always been afraid of meeting that dreadful
man again, and now to know that he was away in England
and a captive, was a great relief to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It does not seem possible,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is righteous judgment that he should at last be taken
by the very one who unjustly served out the sentence that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>ought to have been pronounced upon him threefold,” was the
stern reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me how it happened, please—that is, if you know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; Earle wrote me a good deal about it. It seems
that the fellow did not deem the United States a safe place
for him after John Loker’s confession was made public—the
description of himself was too accurate for that—so he
fled to England, and has undoubtedly been carrying on his
nefarious operations there ever since. About a month after
I left Wycliffe, Earle was awakened one night by the sound
as of some one stepping cautiously around in his dressing-room.
His revolver was in reach, and he instantly secured
it. The next moment a man passed into his room. It was
not a very dark night, and as the robber glided between
the bed and the window his figure was clearly outlined, and
Earle, aiming low, fired at him. He fell with a groan. It
was but the work of a minute to strike a light and go to
the prostrate man, who was too badly wounded to make any
resistance, and he found that his fallen foe was none other
than his and your enemy Tom Drake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a strange adventure; and—Earle was in great danger,”
Editha whispered, with a deep-drawn breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but the strangest of all is yet to come,” pursued
Mr. Tressalia. “Instead of giving the wretch up to the
authorities, as any one else would have done in spite of
his fearful sufferings, he enjoined strictest silence upon the
servants, called in the old family physician and swore him
to secrecy, and is now nursing the wretch back to health
as tenderly as if he was his own brother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is just like Earle’s nobility—he is ‘a noble of nature’s
own creating!’” said Editha, admiringly; and her face
glowed with pride for this grand act of one whom she so
fondly loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was the man very severely injured?” she asked, after
a moment of silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, in the thigh; he will probably be a cripple for life,
Earle says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How sad! What will be done with him when he recovers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle did not write what his intentions were, but he will
probably be transported for life, where, with a ball and chain
attached to him, you will never need fear him any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor fellow! The English laws are more severe than
our own, then,” she said, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the laws of the United States were more stringent,
and the penalties for extreme cases more severe, your prisons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>would not be so full, and, in my opinion, there would be
less mischief done,” Mr. Tressalia replied, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment some one spoke his name, and, turning,
they saw Madam Sylvester and her brother approaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pleasant greetings were exchanged, and then they all
sought seats at a little distance near a fountain for a few
moments’ conversation before returning to their hotel.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Mr. Dalton turned so abruptly and left Mr. Tressalia
and Editha he was indeed terribly excited.</p>

<p class='c007'>He walked rapidly to a remote portion of the park, where,
out of the sight and sound of every one, he paced back and
forth under the trees, muttering fierce imprecations upon
some one, and gesticulating in a wild and angry manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must get away from here at once,” he muttered. “Whatever
could have possessed <em>them</em> to follow us here? Of
course <em>she</em> cannot <em>know</em> anything, and what especial interest
can she have in my daughter? But I’m terribly afraid
some unlucky remark or question will expose all—Editha
is so <em>charmingly ingenuous</em>,” he went on, with sarcastic
bitterness; “and I have lost enough already—I will not be
balked at this late day. I have fought fate all my life, and
now I’ll conquer or die. We will get out of this place instantly;
and since they are French, they will not mind, perhaps,
if we take ‘French leave.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>A half-hour or more Mr. Dalton spent by himself giving
vent to his anger and vexation, and then, in a somewhat
calmer frame of mind, he went to seek Editha to return
to their hotel. He was obliged to search some time, for
the throng was immense, and it was no easy matter to discover
a person once lost sight of.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he found them at length all together, Madam Sylvester
and her brother, Mr. Tressalia and Editha, standing
by one of the fountains, as if they had just arisen from
their seats and were contemplating retiring from the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam was standing by Editha, her arm lightly clasping
her waist, and talking in her gentle, charming way, while
the young girl’s eyes were fixed upon her face in a look
of earnest admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A very touching scene,” sneered Mr. Dalton, as he came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>in sight of them. “A clear case of mutual affinity that is
remarkable under the circumstances. My daughter seems
to possess a power of attraction <em>in certain directions</em> that is
truly wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood looking at the group for a few moments with
a dark frown upon his brow, and as if undecided whether
it was best to advance or retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'>He seemed at length to decide upon the latter course, for
he turned, and was about slipping away, when Editha espied
him, and called out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is now. Papa, come here, please;” and she
went toward him, drawing Madam Sylvester with her. “I
want to introduce you to my friend, Madam Sylvester,”
she said, with a sweet smile, and all unsuspicious of the
tempest raging within Mr. Dalton’s bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was done, and there was no escape now; but it was a
very pale face that Sumner Dalton bent before madam and
the steel-like glitter of his eyes repelled her, and made
her think of Editha as a poor lamb in the clutches of a
wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She does not look like him; she must resemble her
mother; but she has hair and eyes like——” was madam’s
inward comment, but which was broken short off at this point
with a regretful sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the next moment she had turned to him again with
her usual graciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton,” she said, “I have been telling your daughter
how disappointed I was to find her gone so suddenly from
Newport. I had only just become acquainted with her, to be
sure, but I had promised myself much pleasure in my intercourse
with her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton bowed and smiled, and mechanically repeated
something stereotyped about “mutual pleasure,” &#38;c., and then
turned to be presented to Mr. Gustave Sylvester, but not
before madam had noticed again that steel-like glitter in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear,” she said to Editha, “I have not yet asked
you where you are stopping?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the Grand Union.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is capital, for we have all secured rooms there
also, and I hope we shall see much of each other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope so, too,” Editha said, heartily, and thinking how
all her life she had longed for just such a friend as she
thought madam would be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long do you remain?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“I am sure I cannot tell. As long as papa desires, I suppose,
as I make my plans conform to his as much as possible,”
and Editha cast an anxious glance at Mr. Dalton,
whose strange manner she had remarked; and was somewhat
troubled by it. He was sustaining rather a forced
conversation with Mr. Gustave Sylvester, but his manner
was nervous and his brow gloomy and lowering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are looking better than when I saw you at Newport,”
madam said, with an admiring glance at her beautiful
companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I think my health is improving,” Editha answered;
but she sighed as she said it, and a look of pain crossed
her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking of her ill-health always reminded her of its
cause, and sent her thoughts flying over the sea to Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sigh touched madam, for she divined its cause; and,
drawing the fair girl a little closer within her encircling
arm, she laid her lips against her ear and tenderly whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must never forget, dear, no matter how dark our
lot, that One has said, ‘Thy strength is sufficient for thee.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha started, and her lip quivered a trifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think it is possible to realize that under all circumstances?”
she asked, a slight tremulousness in her tone,
notwithstanding her effort at self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam drew her gently one side, and began walking slowly
around the fountain, in order to be beyond the hearing
of the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the first moments of our blind, unreasoning grief,
perhaps not,” she answered, with grave sweetness. “I have
known, dear child, what it is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To wander on without a ray of hope,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To find no respite even in our sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Life’s sun extinguished, in the dark to grope,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And hopeless through the weary world to creep.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That is the way life seemed to me once, but in time I came
to realize that in this world of weary toil and waiting there
must be some burden-bearers, and God meant me to be one
of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But all burdens are not heavy alike,” murmured Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, dear; but if ‘Our Father’ sends them, we may be
very sure that it is right for us to bear them; and Frances
Anne Kemble tells us:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>‘A sacred burden is this life ye bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Look on it—lift it, bear it patiently,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stand up and walk beneath it steadfastly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>But onward, upward, till the goal ye win.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Those are brave, cheering words. If I could but have
some kind comforter like you all the time, I could bear it
better,” Editha said, with fast-dropping tears, and realizing
more than she had ever done before how utterly alone she
was in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, you forget the great Divine Comforter.
Haven’t you yet learned to trust Him?” madam asked, with
great tenderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—oh, yes; at least I <em>thought</em> I had until this last trouble
came upon me, which has made it seem almost as if ‘a
blank despair like the shadow of a starless night was thrown
over the world in which I moved alone.’ Many and many
a time I have felt as if I must lie down like a weary child
and weep out the life of sorrow which I have borne, and
which I still must bear until the end,” the young girl said,
with almost passionate earnestness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My poor child, how my heart grieves for you. Mr.
Tressalia has told me something of your trouble, and I
think I never knew of anything quite so sad before; but,
believe me, some good must come out of it. You are
young, and this sad lesson patiently learned will give you
strength of character for the future, whatever it may be.
You know we are told that out of sorrow we come forth
purified if we bear it rightly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I fear I shall never become purified,” Editha answered,
bitterly. “I <em>cannot</em> bear it rightly. I am not patient.
My heart is constantly rebelling against the unjustness, as
it seems to me, of it all. Why did not some instinct warn
me that Earle was my brother before I had learned to love
him so well?” she concluded, wildly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, dear,” madam said, with gentle reproof, but her
fine face was very grave and troubled. “We cannot understand
the <em>why</em> of a great many things; we know that they
<em>are</em>, and we have no right to question the wisdom of anything
that is beyond our comprehension; but I am greatly
interested in this sorrow of yours and the young Marquis
of Wycliffe. I know it will do you good to unburden your
heart, and if you can trust me who am almost a stranger
to you, tell me more about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not seem like a stranger to me. You are more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>like a dear, long-tried friend, and I can never tell you how
comforting your kind sympathy is to me,” Editha returned,
with eyes full of tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam’s only reply was a closer clasp around the slender
waist, and the young girl continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When we met you that day in Redwood Library at Newport,
and your hand closed over mine with such a strong
yet fond clasp, and you looked into my eyes in that earnest,
tender way you have, I could have wound my arms about
your neck and wept out my grief upon your bosom even
then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam’s eyes were full of tears now, but Editha did not
see them, and went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will gladly tell you all about my sad trouble, only I
would not like to weary you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will not weary me, dear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And so Editha, won more and more by this beautiful
woman’s sweetness and gentleness, poured into her sympathizing
ear all her story, beginning with the time Earle
had come a poor boy into her uncle’s employ, and ending
with their final separation when they were told that they
were both children of one father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a very strange, sad history,” madam said, when
she had finished; “but the facts of the case are so very
evident that there can be no way of disputing them; and
this uncle of yours, what a noble man he was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he was mamma’s brother, and a dear, dear uncle.
Oh! if he could but have lived,” Editha sighed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, he could not have prevented this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but he would have comforted me as no other could
have done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were every fond of him, then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I believe I loved him better than any one in the
world. That does not seem just right to say, perhaps, when
papa and mamma were living, but he was always so sympathizing
and tender with me. He would always listen patiently
and with interest to all my little trials, and sympathize with
me when everybody else laughed at them as trifles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Had he no family of his own?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; he was what we call an old bachelor,” Editha replied,
with a little smile; “and he was the dearest old bachelor
that ever lived. I used to think sometimes that he must
have loved some one long ago, for there were times when
he was very sad. But he never seemed to like the ladies
very well; he would never go into company if he could
help it, and, whenever I said anything to him about it, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>used to tell me, in a laughing way, that he was waiting to
be my escort, so as to frighten away all unworthy suitors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did not like the society of ladies, you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; he was always coldly polite to them, but would
never show them any attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He liked <em>one</em> well enough, it seems, to leave her all his
fortune,” madam said, with an arch look into the beautiful
face at her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he gave me all he had, excepting the ten thousand
that Earle was to have. I was always his ‘pet,’ his
‘ray of sunshine,’ his ‘happiness,’ but I would rather have
my dear, kind uncle back than all the fortunes in the world,”
she said sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was your mother’s brother, you say, dear—what was
his name?” asked madam, who had been very deeply interested
in all she had heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a name that he was always very proud of—Ri——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha!” suddenly called Mr. Dalton from behind them.
“I have been chasing you around for the last half-hour. Do
you know what time it is?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, papa.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is after one, and time that delicate people were at
rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well; I am ready to go now, if you wish,” she said,
quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tressalia and Mr. Sylvester now joined them, and
the former made some proposal to madam regarding an excursion
for the morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they were discussing the question Mr. Dalton tried
to hurry Editha away, regardless of the propriety of the
thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must bid them good-night, papa,” she said, coldly, and
wilfully standing her ground, while she wondered at his extreme
haste.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be quick about it, then, for I am dused tired,” he said,
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>She then said good-night to them in a general way, and
turned to accompany her father, not very well pleased to
be treated so like a child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear,” called madam, with an anxious look in her
eye, as she saw how pale and weary Editha was looking,
“get all the rest you can, and then come to me as soon as
you have breakfasted to-morrow, for I have something very
particular to say to you. My room is No. 105.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha promised, while Sumner Dalton ground his teeth
with inward rage at this familiar request.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“What you can see in <em>her</em> to admire is more than I can
imagine,” he remarked, curtly, on their way out of the park.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, papa, where are your eyes? I think she is the
most charming woman I ever met,” Editha replied, with
unwise enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I prefer you should not be quite so free with an entire
stranger—it is not proper,” he growled.</p>

<p class='c007'>She set her little chin, and her eyes flashed with a light
which told that she considered herself old enough and capable
of judging for herself upon such matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you enjoyed the evening?” she asked, avoiding any
reply to his remark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well enough until <em>they</em> came,” was the curt retort.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry if you do not like my new friends, papa, but
I thought you used to admire Mr. Tressalia,” Editha returned,
a little spirit of mischief prompting the last half of
her remark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is well enough, only, according to my way of looking
at things, it does not seem just the thing for him to be
hanging around you all the time and running after you as
if you belonged to him,” Mr. Dalton said, crossly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was evidently entirely out of sorts, and Editha knew
it would be better to let the matter drop, but she could not
resist one more little shaft.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought you liked me to receive Mr. Tressalia’s attentions,”
she said, innocently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I did once, but circumstances alter cases sometimes;
and—we will not discuss Mr. Tressalia further, if you
please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was undeniably cross, and she was glad to escape to
her room as soon as they reached the hotel, while she was
inwardly rejoicing at the prospect of having Madam Sylvester’s
companionship for awhile at least.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam stood and watched her as she left them and moved
away with her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face was very sad and her voice trembled slightly
as, turning to her brother, she asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of whom does she remind you, Gustave?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of no one in particular,” he returned, indifferently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not of——” and she bent forward and whispered the
rest of the sentence in his ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not if my memory serves me right,” he said, shaking
his head; “and yet,” he added, “there <em>may</em> be an expression
about the eyes that is familiar. I had not thought of it
before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gustave, her name is Editha,” madam said, in a low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>voice, her face very pale, and with an eager look into her
brother’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are doubtless a thousand Edithas in the world;
do not allow yourself to become imaginative at this late
day, Estelle,” he returned; and, dropping the matter there,
madam signified her readiness to return to the hotel also.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XL<br> <span class='large'>ADIEU TO SARATOGA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Editha had told her maid that she need not sit up for
her, as it would doubtless be very late when she returned
from the park; but she almost regretted that she had done
so, for, on reaching her room, and with the false strength
which excitement gives gone, she found herself very weak
and weary.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sank listlessly into a chair and began removing her
ornaments, and while thus engaged there came a knock
upon her door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost simultaneously it was opened, for she had not
locked it, and Mr. Dalton thrust in his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Annie?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In bed, papa. I told her she need not wait for me.
Do you want anything very particularly?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to see you,” he replied, coming in and shutting the
door. “I am sorry it is so late. I wish we had come home
earlier. I have had bad news. I have important business,
that calls me home immediately,” he concluded, speaking disconnectedly
and excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Home?” exclaimed Editha, greatly surprised, and feeling
deeply disappointed, for, of course, she knew he would
expect her to go with him. Besides, she could not bear
the thought of leaving so soon after Madam Sylvester’s
arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; we must start by six to-morrow morning. Can you
be ready?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So soon?” she said, with a weary sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I must go immediately. If there was a train in
an hour, and we could get ready, I would take it,” he answered,
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, papa, what can possibly have happened to recall
you so suddenly?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“You would not understand if I should tell you,” he said,
uneasily; “it is private business of my own. Will you be
ready?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is very little time,” Editha replied, wearily. “Would it
not do to wait a day or two longer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not an hour longer than it will take to pack our
trunks and catch a train,” Mr. Dalton said, with a frown.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was beginning to be very angry to be thus opposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <em>wish</em> this had not happened just now, and <em>they</em> have
only arrived to-night,” Editha murmured, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton scowled angrily, and muttered something about
the selfishness of women generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha sat thinking for a few moments, and then asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Could you not go home without me, papa, if this business
is so very urgent? I would really like to remain at the
Springs a little longer, and I know that Madam Sylvester
would gladly act as my chaperon until you can return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was all that Mr. Dalton could do to suppress an oath
at this request.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” he said, quickly. “I am nearly sick with all
this worry and fuss, and I cannot spare you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He did indeed look worried over something, and his face
was pale, his eyes very bright and restless; but Editha could
not think it necessary that she should be hurried off in such
an unheard-of manner, just for a matter of business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you must go, and think you cannot get along without
me, suppose you go on an early train, and I will follow
with Annie later?” she said. “A few hours cannot make
much difference to you, and I really think it would be uncivil
to hurry away so, and without even a word of farewell
to our friends. Besides, I promised I would see Madam
Sylvester in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think you were fairly bewitched with this French
madam. I will not have it. You must return with me;
and, if report speaks the truth, your wonderful friend is no
fit companion for <em>my</em> daughter,” Mr. Dalton cried, with angry
hauteur.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you knew her before to-night. I thought so from
your manner. <em>What</em> do you know about her?” Editha asked,
greatly surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot say that I had that honor,” her father returned,
sarcastically. “I never spoke with her until to-night, and
I cannot say that I wish to extend the acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is a very lovely, as well as a good, pure woman,”
Editha asserted, with flushing cheeks, and indignant with
him for speaking so slightingly of her new friend. “Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Tressalia,” she added, “knows all about her, and he says
that, excepting for a mistake or two during the early part
of her life, her character is above suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A mistake or two in one’s early life, as you express it,
often ruins one for all time,” remarked Mr. Dalton, dryly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having proved the truth of that axiom to a certain extent,
he knew whereof he spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you would not be willing for me to remain with
her under any circumstances?” Editha asked, with a searching
look into his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not; and I desire you to hold no further communication
with her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will have to give me some good and sufficient reason
for your wish before I shall feel called upon to comply
with it,” she returned, firmly, and calmly meeting his eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think that by this time you had seen the folly
of defying me,” he said, with a fierceness that was startling.
“But enough of this. I suppose you consent to return
with me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, rather than have any more words about it; but I
am very much disappointed,” she returned, with a sigh, and
beginning to think that Mr. Dalton was jealous of her sudden
liking for Madam Sylvester, and that was why he was
hurrying her away so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And please do not trouble yourself to inform Mr. Tressalia
<em>or any one else</em> concerning our plans. I do not care
to have my steps dogged again as they have been hither, and
for which it seems I have you to thank,” her father said,
fretfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha glanced at him in a puzzled way; she could not
understand him to-night.</p>

<p class='c007'>That he was strangely excited over something she could
see, for he was very pale, his eyes glowed fiercely, and he
was very nervous and irritable, and she did not really believe
his story regarding urgent business calling him home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somehow she became possessed with the idea that madam
was in some way connected with this inexplicable move, but
how or why she could not imagine.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better call Annie, and I will help you pack
your trunks, so that there will be nothing to do in the morning,”
Mr. Dalton said, rising and beginning to gather up
some articles that lay on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was an expert at packing, and Editha, too utterly
wearied out to feel equal to any effort, was glad to avail
herself of this offer.</p>

<p class='c007'>She went to call Annie, wondering if all her life-long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>she would have to be subject to his caprices in this way, and
feeling more sad than she could express.</p>

<p class='c007'>In less than an hour, under the nimble and experienced
fingers of Mr. Dalton and Annie, every article was packed,
the trunks strapped, and labeled, and ready for the porter to
take down in the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the weary girl crept into bed, feeling more friendless
and alone than ever before, and wept herself to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been forbidden to communicate with Mr. Tressalia
regarding their departure, and she did not know
whether she should ever meet him again, and it seemed such
a shabby and unkind way to treat a friend who had sacrificed
so much for her. She had been forbidden to hold any
further communication with Madam Sylvester, for whom
she was beginning to feel a strong affection, and all this
by a man selfish and domineering, and determined to bend
her to his lightest will.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew that she could refuse point-blank to obey him
if she chose—she could go her own way and he his; but
if she did this she would cut herself loose from every hold
upon the old life, and from every natural tie—she would
not have a friend left in the world, while Mr. Dalton would
also be left alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every day she was conscious that her affection for him
waned more and more, but for her mother’s sake she could
not quite bear the thought of leaving him without any restraining
influences; besides, if she should pursue any such
course, she would take away all his means of support, for his
ten thousand was slipping through his fingers like water.</p>

<p class='c007'>She never stopped to reason that this might be the very
best thing she could do—that if he stood in a little wholesome
fear of losing his present share of her handsome income,
he would not be likely to domineer over her quite to
such an extent. But the future looked darker than ever
to her, and her heart was very sad and depressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At five o’clock the next morning Mr. Dalton came to
arouse her and her maid, and as soon as she was dressed
he sent her up a tempting little breakfast, with a word to
take plenty of time and eat all she could.</p>

<p class='c007'>This he had accomplished by heavily feeing one of the
waiters the night before, and the steaming cup of rich
chocolate, the broiled chicken done to a turn, the eggs
and delicate toast, really formed an appetizing meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>With all his selfishness and the determination to bend
Editha to his own will, Mr. Dalton always liked to have her
fare well, as well as dress richly and becomingly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>At six o’clock the early train steamed out of the Saratoga
depot, and Editha could not refrain from dropping a few
more tears behind her vail as a sad farewell to the friends
whom she feared she should never meet again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton eyed her closely, but was too well pleased
to have got her away so successfully to trouble her with any
more words about the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they arrived in their own city, some time during
the afternoon, Mr. Dalton proposed that they go directly
to some hotel, since their own house was shut up, and no
word had been sent to the servants to prepare for their coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha assented, and he engaged some cheerful, handsome
rooms in a first-class house for them both.</p>

<p class='c007'>A week went by, and she thought it strange he should
say no more about going home; and one day she ventured
to suggest their return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe I like it here better,” he said, glancing around
the beautiful room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better than our own spacious home?” Editha cried, astonished.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew that their elegant house on —th street had
always been the pride of his heart, and the one thing he
mourned about at Newport or anywhere else was the want of
the comforts and conveniences of their elegantly appointed
residence.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his confession to Earle that he was a ruined man,
his house and furniture mortgaged, and the mortgage liable
to be foreclosed any day, she had generously proposed clearing
it off, and it was now free from debt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” he replied to her surprised remark; “the house
seems so large and lonely with only two people in it besides
the servants, and really I have never been so comfortable
at any hotel before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know; but one has so much more freedom in one’s own
home,” Editha said, disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hotel life was always obnoxious to her, and her father
knew it, too. But her preferences were of minor importance
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” he said; “but there is a great deal of care in providing
for a family, and I shall get rid of all that if we
board. I propose that we rent the house for awhile; it will
give us a snug little sum, and it will be more economical
to live this way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha opened her eyes wide at this new departure. She
had never heard her father preach economy before; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>she saw at once where the advantage was coming, and in
her heart she grew very indignant toward him.</p>

<p class='c007'>If he rented the house it would indeed bring <em>him</em> a handsome
sum, which he would pocket, while the hotel bill would
doubtless come out of her income; but though she read him
correctly, in a measure, she did not give him credit for the
deep scheme he had in mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>He thought that Mr. Tressalia, on finding that they had
again taken French leave, would try to find them, and follow
them as he had done before; and if he, with madam
and her brother, should take a notion to seek them there
in the city, and should find their house either closed or
rented, they would come to the conclusion that they were
still absent at some summer resort, and go away again.
Thus he would escape them entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the matter ended, as all such matters ended, in Editha’s
yielding assent.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>Some things in Editha’s story had moved Madam Sylvester
deeply, and she passed a sleepless night after her return
to the hotel on the night of the garden-party.</p>

<p class='c007'>She lay reviewing all the ground, recalling little items
which at the time possessed no significance to her, but which
now impressed her powerfully; she thought of the strange
attraction she felt toward the young girl, and revolved many
other things of which only she and her brother knew anything
about, until it seemed as if she could not wait for
morning to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Mr. Tressalia made his appearance she sought
him and asked him a few questions that she had intended
asking Editha the night before, but had not had an opportunity,
and the effect which his answers produced upon her
startled him not a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>She lost her self-possession entirely, trembled, and grew
frightfully pale, while the tears fairly rained over her fine
face as, grasping both his hands in hers, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friend Paul, you have proved yourself a good <em>genie</em>
more than once; and now shall I tell you something you will
like to know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course he was very curious about the matter; but the
nature of the secret cannot be disclosed just here, although
he deemed it of so much importance that he felt justified
in seeking Mr. Dalton at once, to demand an explanation
regarding some things that had occurred during his early
life.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>He came back to madam with the startling intelligence
that Mr. Dalton and his party had left on the early train.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone?” almost shrieked Madam Sylvester. “He knew
it—he knew what I have told you. I remember how he appeared
last night when he met me, and now he has fled
to escape me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Paul and Mr. Gustave Sylvester were on their mettle
now, and proceeded to ascertain whither Mr. Dalton had
gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The waiter who had served them, and the porter who
had assisted in removing their trunks, were interviewed and
feed, but neither had noticed the labels on the departing
visitors’ baggage, and so their destination was a matter of
doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>But that afternoon madam’s party also bade adieu to
Saratoga, their object being to ferret out the hiding-place of
Sumner Dalton, and compel him to do an act of justice long
delayed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLI<br> <span class='large'>TOM DRAKE’S BEWILDERMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have left Earle for a long time in his magnificent
loneliness at Wycliffe.</p>

<p class='c007'>But magnificent loneliness it indeed was, for in his great
house there was not a soul to whom he could go for either
sympathy or cheer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was surrounded on every hand by everything that almost
unlimited wealth could buy; he possessed one of the
finest estates in England, and farms and forests in France,
which, as yet, he had never seen; he occupied a position
second to none save royalty; he had the finest horses and
carriages in the county; cattle and hounds of choicest breed;
he had all this, and yet he was heart-sick with a bitterness
that seemed unbearable.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could interest himself in nothing—he took pleasure in
nothing—all his fair domains and riches were like a mockery
to him; he never stood in the oriel window that looked
out from the center of the main building at Wycliffe, and
viewed the broad expanse spread out before him, and beautiful
as Eden’s fair gardens, without feeling that he was
cursed worse even than Adam and Eve were cursed when
driven from Paradise.</p>

<p class='c007'>His beautiful gardens, shining streams stocked with finest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>trout, broad fields of waving golden grain, the noble park
with its grand old trees, God’s most glorious handiwork, all
mocked him with their loveliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was as if they said to him, “You can have all this—you
can revel in everything that serves to make the world
bright and beautiful; you can buy and sell, and get gain,
add to your stores, and get fame and honor, but after all is
told, you must ever carry a desolate heart in your bosom;
you can never possess the one jewel worth sevenfold more
than all you possess; you can never behold the fair face,
dearer than all the world, beaming upon you in your home
as you go and come on the round of daily duties.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What did it amount to?—of what value was it all to him
if he could not share it with the only woman whom he could
ever love?</p>

<p class='c007'>He forced himself day after day to go over the estate to
see that everything was in order, and that his commands
were properly obeyed; but there was no heart in anything
that he did, while the servants and workmen all wondered to
see him so sad and dispirited.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interior of Wycliffe was in keeping with the surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Entering the wide and lofty hall, with its carpetings of
velvet, its panelings of polished oak, its rich furnishings,
its statuary and pictures, one gained something of an idea
of the luxury awaiting beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon one side of this hall was a suite of parlors—three
in number.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first and third were large lofty rooms and furnished
alike. The ceilings were paneled and painted in the most
exquisite designs. The walls were delicately tinted, with
rosewood dados, in which were set panels of variegated
marble beautifully carved. The carpets were of a bright
and graceful pattern, and of richest texture, the hangings
of crimson plush, and the furniture, no two pieces of which
were alike, was upholstered to match.</p>

<p class='c007'>The middle room was larger than the other two, and
even more dazzling in its furnishings, and was separated
from the others by arches, supported by graceful marble
columns richly carved. The walls were delicately tinted,
the same as in the other rooms, but the dados were of
white Italian marble. The ceiling was painted with daisies
and buttercups, arranged in most tasteful design; the carpet
was a marvel of richness and delicate beauty—a white
ground dotted with golden heads of wheat; the curtains
were of golden satin festooned with lace; the furniture, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>different kinds of precious wood, inlaid with gold and pearl,
was cushioned with white satin brocaded with golden coreopsis;
the lambrequins, which were of velvet embroidered with
daisies, gave a superb effect to the whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every accessory in the way of mirrors, etageres, pictures,
statuary, etc., was perfect, and the elegance of the whole
suite it would be difficult to exceed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the opposite side of the hall were the library, sitting-rooms,
and dining-room, while leading from the latter was
a very fine conservatory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Above, there were suites of rooms for the family and
guests, and all in keeping with the elegance of those below;
and if wealth and the good things it brings could possibly
gladden the heart of man, Earle Wayne, Marquis of Wycliffe,
ought to be a very happy one.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is an old saying, “Uneasy lies the head that wears
a crown,” and we might add, heavy is the heart whose all
lies in a weighty purse, for in all England it would not
have been possible to find a more wretched being than
Earle Wayne.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the time went by until there came a strange break
in the monotony of his life—the adventure of which Mr.
Tressalia had told Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been told by one of the servants, during the day
before, that a suspicious-looking character was prowling
about the place; but he did not pay much attention to the
matter, and when night came he retired as usual, and went
to sleep without a thought of danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>About two in the morning he had been awakened by
the sound of muffled footsteps in his dressing-room. The
next moment he saw the flash of a dark lantern, and knew
there was mischief brewing.</p>

<p class='c007'>As before related, it was but the work of a second for
him to reach out and grasp his revolver, which, remembering
the robbery at Mr. Dalton’s, he always kept by him
ready for use.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the man passed between his bed and the window,
he knew that was his best chance, and fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intruder dropped instantly, with a groan, and his
lantern went out as it fell to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was out of bed and had struck a light in less time
that it takes to tell it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are you?” he demanded, stooping over his fallen
foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he started back with an exclamation of surprise,
as he immediately recognized the wretch in whose power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>he had found Editha, and who had so cleverly escaped from
him that morning in the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was indeed Tom Drake, and his career as a midnight
robber was ended for all time.</p>

<p class='c007'>He appeared to be suffering terribly, and, upon examination,
Earle found that the ball had entered the leg just below
the thigh, and, as he could not move it, had probably shattered
the bone. Now that his enemy was fallen, Earle’s
sympathies were at once aroused. Suffering in any form
always touched his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my man,” he said, kindly, as he bent over him,
“what am I going to do for you, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess you’ve done for me already,” was the rough
response, accompanied by a fearful oath and a groan as he
recognized his captor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m very sorry to cause you suffering, but ‘self-preservation
is the first law of nature,’ you know,” Earle answered,
as he stepped quickly to the bell-cord and gave it a violent
pull.</p>

<p class='c007'>In less than five minutes a servant appeared in answer
to the summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Robert,” Earle said, as composedly as if nothing
had happened; “I have invited a stranger to stop with me
for a little while. Lend a hand, and we will take him across
the hall to the south suite; then I want you to go for Dr.
Sargeant as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The burglar was borne to the rooms mentioned, but carefully
as he was handled, he fainted during the removal, and
was a long time regaining consciousness afterward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor arrived in about three-quarters of an hour,
and, after much difficulty and probing, succeeded in extracting
the ball. The ugly wound was then dressed, and the
patient made as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the physician was about departing, Earle sought him
privately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please,” he said, “I would like nothing said about
this affair. I do not wish to create any sensation, and the
country will be alive with excitement if the events of to-night
become known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, my lord, the man ought to be given up to justice,”
said the physician, with a frown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one knows better than yourself that he is no fit
subject for justice now, nor will he be for a good while to
come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is so. He’ll have a hard time of it before he
gets through. The bone is shattered. There will be fever,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and a great deal of pain; while if mortification sets in,
he’ll get justice in another world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then please oblige me by keeping the matter quiet, and
do the best you can for him at my expense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely you don’t mean to keep the fellow here?” exclaimed
the doctor, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly. What did you suppose I would do with him?”
Earle asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Send him to the alms-house or hospital. It belongs to
the authorities to take care of such scamps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If a friend of yours had been injured in this way, would
you advocate sending him to the hospital? Would the excitement
and fatigue of the removal be beneficial?” Earle
asked pointedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; inflammation would probably follow, and the patient
would doubtless die,” the physician coolly admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the way I reasoned the question; therefore I
hold myself, in a measure, responsible for this man’s life,”
was the grave reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The earth would be well rid of a villain,” answered
the doctor, gruffly. “It was only the luck of the thing that
prevented your being where he is now, or perhaps a corpse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not ‘luck,’ my friend, but the hand of Providence,”
Earle interposed, with his rare smile. “Your judgment and
my conscience tell me that the man will die unless he has
the very best of care. He must be kept quiet, and free from
anxiety; so I have decided that he shall remain here until
he recovers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But who will take care of him?” asked the physician,
his gruffness all gone, and a look that was not disapprobation
in his eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will see that he lacks for no care or attention; as a
wounded and suffering man, he will be the same to me as
a friend or guest until he gets well; and as such I shall
expect you will also exercise your utmost skill, and do the
very best you can for him,” Earle said, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, well, well!” muttered the astonished disciple of
Esculapius; and then he stood regarding his companion for
a moment, with raised eyebrows, and his mouth puckered
into the smallest possible compass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unless you object to treating such a patient,” Earle added,
with a little hauteur.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, no; bless you, no!” Dr. Sargeant returned quickly.
“I will do my very best for the poor wretch; you are
right—it would be sacrificing his life to have him removed,
and you may rely upon my discretion.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>And the noted doctor went away somewhat mystified as
to what manner of man the young marquis might be, that
he was willing to turn his magnificent home into a hospital
for thieves and robbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle went back to his charge, whom he found restless,
feverish and burning with intolerable thirst.</p>

<p class='c007'>He swore savagely as Earle made his appearance, and
defiantly demanded what he was going to do with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take care of you until you get on your legs again,”
was the calm reply, as he held some pleasant, cooling drink
to the man’s parched lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>He drank eagerly, and then fell back among the soft
pillows with a groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh! that’s a likely story!” he returned, after a minute,
with an angry flash of his eyes; “out with it, and don’t
keep me in suspense; I’ve enough to bear with this pain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you have, poor fellow!” Earle answered, kindly; “and
it is just as I have told you—you are to stay here and
be nursed until you get well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! stay here?” and the man’s eyes wandered around
the luxurious apartment in a look of amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, in this very room. Don’t you know that you cannot
bear to be removed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t feel much like it, that’s a fact,” he said, suppressing
another groan; “but”—with a keen look into the
kind face above him—“what right have <em>you</em> to say it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The right of ownership—I am master here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>You!</em>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; you recognize me, then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I do; and you knew me instanter, which isn’t
strange, considering one isn’t likely to forget a phiz like
mine; but—but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you had no idea that you were breaking into <em>my</em>
house when you came here last night,” interrupted Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I’ll be —— if I did!” was the irreverent but energetic reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There has been a change in my circumstances of late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think so! Then <em>you</em> are the Marquis of Wycliffe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. What did you expect to find here in the way of
plunder?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may as well own up, I suppose, since I’m where I
can’t help myself,” the man replied, recklessly. “I was
after the family jewels, which I was told were kept here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are not here. I had them deposited in the treasure
vault more than a month ago. There was only a little money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>in my safe, for I had paid off my help only yesterday; so
you see, my friend, you have had your sin and risked your
life for nothing,” Earle said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Drake swore savagely again at this information.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not be profane—indeed I must request you to drop
that sort of talk while you are here,” Earle said, with decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you really don’t mean to send me to the hospital?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed. I do not need to tell you that you have
a long, hard job before you from the wound my ball gave
you, and that it will be a good while before you will get
about again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle thought he might as well talk of things just as
they were. Tom Drake nodded assent, a look of grim endurance
on his ugly face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And,” continued Earle, “unless you have good care—the
very best care—it is doubtful whether you ever have the use
of your leg again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what should that matter to <em>you</em>?” was the gruff
query, accompanied by a suspicious glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It matters this to me: One whom I profess to serve
has bidden me to care for the sick and needy,” Earle said,
gently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! that’s all cant. You’ll watch me as a cat does
a mouse, and just as soon as I begin to spruce up a little,
you’ll hand me over to her majesty’s minions, and I shall
have a nice little ornament attached to my leg, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He tried to put a bold front on, but it was evident that
he experienced considerable anxiety regarding his future.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be time enough to talk of that matter by and
by,” Earle answered; indeed, he had not given a thought to
the subject, and had no idea what course he should pursue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I have to give you this quieting powder,” he added,
taking up one from the table, “and the doctor wishes you
to get all the rest and sleep you can before the inflammation
increases.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He mixed the powder in some kind of tempting jelly,
the man watching him curiously all the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is going to take care of me?” he asked, after he
had swallowed it and taken a cooling draught.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall take care of you for the present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You!” with another curious look. “I suppose you’ve
plenty of servants?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They would do to look after a chap like me; and”—speaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>more humbly than he had yet done—“this is too
fine a room to upset on my account.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was encouraging; it showed that the wretch had a
little feeling and regret for the trouble he was giving.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle bent nearer and said, in a friendly tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not trust you to the care of servants until the
doctor pronounces your wound to be mending. If you should
be neglected ever so little, there is no telling what the result
might be. As for the room, you need give yourself no
uneasiness about it; you are to have just as much attention
as if you were my friend or my brother. Now try to forget
that you have been my enemy, as I shall; for as you are situated
now, I feel only sympathy for you. You must not talk
any more, but try to get some rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle smoothed the tumbled bed-clothes, changed the wet
cloth upon the sufferer’s burning head, drew down the curtains
to shade the light from his eyes, and was about to
seat himself at a distance and leave him to sleep, when his
voice again arrested him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” he asked, again coming to his side to see if he
wished anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man hesitated a minute while he searched his face
keenly, and then burst forth:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am <em>cussed</em> if I can make out what kind of a chap you
are, anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle smiled slightly at his evident perplexity, and the
invalid continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“First, you hit a fellow a swinger on the back of the
head that knocks the life out of him, and makes one think
that the fury of seven Jupiters is concentrated in you; next,
you shoot him with a revolver, and then turn around and
nurse him as tender as a woman—I can’t make it out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did give you a heavy blow that night in the hotel, I
admit; the case was desperate, and I knew I must not fail
to lay you out the first time. If you had not escaped, I
should have given you up to the authorities, and you would
doubtless have been serving out your sentence now, instead
of lying here. But you are wounded and suffering, you will
probably, be sick a long time, and however much I may think
you deserve punishment for your past crimes, your condition
appeals to my humanity. As a sufferer, you are, instead
of an enemy and a robber, my neighbor, my friend, and
as such I shall treat you while you lie here,” Earle explained,
and there was no mistaking the friendliness of his tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your neighbor! your friend!” Tom Drake repeated, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>low, suppressed tones, and feeling almost as if he had got
into a new world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, just that; and now, to ease your mind and make
you trust me, I will tell you that no one save the doctor,
myself, and my servants, know what transpired last night,
and no one else will know of the affair while you are sick
here. Now go to sleep, if you can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle moved away without giving him a chance to reply,
the man watching his retreating figure in stupid amazement.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLII<br> <span class='large'>TOM DRAKE’S TRUST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tom Drake did have a hard time, as the physician predicted
and Earle feared.</p>

<p class='c007'>He paid dearly for his one night’s adventure within the
walls of Wycliffe; and yet, perchance, the end will prove it
to have been a “blessing in disguise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For three weeks he raved in the wildest delirium of fever,
unconscious alike of his own condition, the care he was receiving,
or the trouble and weariness he caused, and it was
three weeks longer before the skilful physician pronounced
him out of danger, or would give any hope that the
wounded limb could be saved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Save it if you can, doctor; the poor fellow has had a
rough time of it, and I should dislike to send him away
from here a cripple,” Earle had pleaded, when the doctor
spoke of amputation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will be a cripple any way; so much of the bone is
diseased and will have to come out, that the leg will always
be weak, and he will be lame, even if we save it. But for
your sake I will do my best, though it is more than the
wretch deserves,” grumbled the physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not much faith or patience in nursing the “miserable
wretch,” as he called him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like enough he will turn round and cut your throat,
some fine day, when he gets well. Such people have no
feeling, no gratitude; they are like the brutes and have
no souls, and should be treated accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least
of these,’” Earle gravely repeated once, after one of the
doctor’s outbursts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“Humph! such high-toned philanthropy will doubtless be
rewarded in a way you don’t expect.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But with all his apparent gruffness and contempt for
the kindness Earle was bestowing upon the unfortunate criminal,
the young marquis could see that he was always very
gentle with him, and was satisfied that he was bestowing the
very best treatment that his knowledge and skill could suggest.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at last the fever left him he lay weak as a baby,
and only able to be lifted gently in the arms of strong
men when he wished to change his position.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not look nearly so repulsive to Earle as he lay
there so pale, and thin, and helpless, and a great pity crept
into his heart for this brother-man whose life had been so
steeped in sin and infamy.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had scarcely left him during those six long weeks
when he lay in such danger, catching what rest he could
while his patient slept, and lying upon a couch near his
bed; and Earle himself looked almost as if he had had
a fit of sickness, he was so worn and weary with his watching.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was six weeks longer before Tom Drake could be
dressed and move about his room, supported by a servant
on one side and a crutch on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had grown more quiet and gentle in his manner during
these weeks of convalescence. After regaining consciousness
when his fever turned, his speech became more chaste,
no oath left his lips to offend Earle’s ears, while now and
then some expression of gratitude, rough though it was,
would escape him for the attention and kindness he was
receiving.</p>

<p class='c007'>He became very thoughtful, even sad at times, and then
Earle would bring some interesting book and read to him;
but though he listened attentively, and appeared grateful
for the attention, yet he could see that he did not really
enjoy it, and often grew nervous at the monotonous sound
of his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day he brought in a beautiful chess-table, and, after
arranging the curiously carved men upon it, asked him if
he would like to learn the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was astonished to see his face light up with delight,
as he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha! them are real beauties, and now I can stand it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He already knew the game—was even a skilful player
and from that time until he was able to ride out, Earle
was never at a loss to know how to amuse him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>But as he grew stronger, Earle could see that some heavy
burden oppressed him, and when not riding or playing chess,
he would sit in moody silence, his hands folded, his head
bent, and a look of deep trouble on his face, and frequent
sighs escaped him.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day Earle had been reading the newspaper to him—the
only thing of the literary kind in which he manifested
any interest. A heavy sigh interrupted him, and
looking up, he found his companion’s eyes fixed sadly on
his face, while apparently he had not heard a word that he
had been reading.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Tom, are you feeling badly to-day?” Earle asked,
laying down his paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“N-o,” he returned, hesitatingly, and with some embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with an air of recklessness that Earle had not noticed
before during all his sickness, he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say, what kind of a place is Botany Bay?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle started, the question was so entirely unexpected;
but he understood at once now why he had been so sad
and absent-minded of late. He had been thinking of his
probable future.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is supposed to be rather a desolate kind of place,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Folks who are sent there at the expense of the Crown,
don’t get rich very fast, and it is somewhat inconvenient
about getting away from there if one should happen to
wish to visit his native land, eh?” Tom Drake said, with a
ghastly attempt to be facetious.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” Earle replied, very gravely, and with a searching
glance at his companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s some comfort in knowing a fellow hain’t got to
leave many behind him to grieve over him,” he said, absently,
and as if speaking more to himself than to Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where do your friends reside?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All the friend I’ve got in the world, sir, is my old mother,
and her I haven’t seen for many a long year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle thought there was a suspicious huskiness in his
voice as he said this, and that a tear dropped on his hand
as he turned quickly to look out of the window; but he
might have been mistaken, and the man was still very
weak after his long illness, and tears come unbidden at such
a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your mother! Have you a mother living?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, as good a woman as ever drew breath,” Tom
said, heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“Who was that woman you had at the hotel in New
York?” Earle asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was one of—the profession. She was nothing to
me, and I paid her well for that job. I—I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” Earle said, encouragingly, as he saw Tom evidently
had something on his mind, and did not know just
how to get rid of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ain’t usually very white-livered nor tender-hearted, sir.
I never thought I was thin-skinned; but—I—I want to tell
you that that rascally business about the young lady has laid
heavily on my mind this many a day. She was a—particular
friend o’ yours, weren’t she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” Earle said, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Drake started at the sound, and shot an anxious
glance at him, while he grew, if possible, paler than he was
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I hope, sir, no harm came to her from the mesmerizing,”
he said, in a sort of hushed tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; she is quite well now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom looked intensely relieved, and went on, speaking
with a rough kind of earnestness and gratitude:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve been wonderful good to me after it all; you’ve
given me the best you have, and treated me as if I were a
gentleman instead of a gallows-bird. That was a pesky
job—that business with the girl. She was a pretty little
thing, but plucky as the—I beg pardon, sir; but she was
the most spirited little woman I ever set eyes on; and
many a time it has given me the shivers, on waking up in
the night, to think of her lying there, growing so pale and
weak, dying by inches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a cruel thing to do,” Earle said, with a far-away
look and a very pale face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He, too, often remembered that waxen face, with its
great mournful eyes, in the still hours of the night; but
that now was not the saddest of his troubles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are right, sir,” Tom went on, with a strange mixture
of humility and defiance; “but I had three or four fat
jobs on hand just at that time, and I knew that if John
Loker’s confession got abroad, there’d be no more work for
me in the United States. I was going to crack a safe that
very night, and had all my tools about me; so, as soon
as you took the young lady off, I set to work, picked the
locks, and we took to our heels with all the speed we had.
You hadn’t made much noise about the affair, so when
madam and I walked out of the private entrance together,
no one suspected us, and we got off scot-free. I knew it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>wouldn’t be safe for me to be seen around there after that,
so I made for a steamer that was just ready to start out, and
came over here to try my luck, never dreaming I’d fall into
<em>your</em> clutches a second time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you been at this kind of thing long?” Earle asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nigh on to twenty years. I got in with a gang when
I was a youngster, learned all the tricks of the trade, and
have lived by my wits and a burglar’s kit ever since.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you, as a rule, found it a very <em>satisfactory</em> kind
of business?” his listener asked, pointedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Drake flushed a vivid crimson, and for an instant
a fierce gleam of anger shot from his eye; then he burst out
vehemently:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>No, sir; I haven’t.</em> I’ve always had to hide and sneak
about like a whipped cur. It’s all up with me now, though,
and I might as well own to it first as last, and there’s no
comfort in it from beginning to end; but when a fellow
once gets started in it, there don’t seem to be any place
to stop, however bad you may want to. I’d got kind of
hardened to it, though, until—until that job at Dalton’s that
<em>you</em> got hauled up for. I’ve cursed myself times without
number for that affair, but I hadn’t the grit to own up
and take my chances; though, if I did put on a bold front,
every hair on my head stood on end when I saw you stand
up so proud and calm, and take the sentence and never
squeal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom was getting excited over the remembrance, and his
whole frame shook, while Earle could see the perspiration
that had gathered on his upper lip.</p>

<p class='c007'>His eyes were bent upon his hands, which were trembling
with nervousness, or some other emotion, and his voice
was not quite steady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re a gentleman, sir, every inch of you,” he went
on, after a few minutes of awkward silence. “I’ve heard
charity preached about no end of times, and never knew
what it meant before. I suppose you won’t believe it, or
think I am capable of feeling it, but I do—I feel mean
clear through, though I never would have owned to it
before. Here I’ve been for three months and more, making
a deal of trouble, being waited upon by your servants as if
I was a prince, drinking your wine, and eating all sorts
of nice things that I never thought to taste, while you’ve
tended me until you’re nigh about worn out yourself. I
tell you I feel—mean! There, it’s out—I couldn’t hold it
any longer; and if I have to wear a ball and chain all
the rest of my life, I shall feel better to think I’ve said it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and I shall never forget to my dying day that there was
one man in the world who was willing to do a kindness to
his worst enemy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had assumed a roughness of tone that had been unusual
for the last few weeks, but Earle knew it was done to
cover his emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was evident that he felt every word he uttered, and
that the confession had cost him a great effort, as his nervousness
and pallor testified.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was apparent also that he expected no mercy, as his
reference to Botany Bay and the ball and chain plainly
showed. Earle pitied him during his long siege of suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a man of no small amount of intelligence, and
had evidently received a moderately good education before
he began his career of crime, and if he had started right
in life he would, no doubt, have made a smart man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle had as yet come to no definite decision as to what
course he should pursue regarding him when he should fully
recover, and he could not bear to think of it even now.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew that his sentence, if tried and found guilty,
would be a very severe one, and his own sad experience
naturally made him incline to the side of mercy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Tom, whatever you may have been in the past,
I do not consider that you are my enemy now,” he said,
kindly, when he had concluded his excited speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I <em>am</em>, sir. I have done you the worst wrong a man
can do another—I’ve wronged you in <em>every</em> way—I’m a
wretch, and whatever they do with me, it’ll serve me right,
and I’ll never open my lips,” he said, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you have wronged me, and I have suffered in your
stead the worst disgrace that a man can suffer. But that is
all past now; my innocence has been established, and no
shadow of sin rests on my name—John Loker’s confession
accomplished that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, sir, it could not give you back those three years
of your life that—that you lost; you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” Earle interrupted; “but those three years, long
and weary as they were, were not ‘lost’ by any means, Tom.
They taught me a lesson of patience and trust which, perhaps,
I never should have learned in any other way. It was
a hard trial—a <em>bitter</em> trial!” Earle exclaimed, with a shudder,
as something of the horror came back to him; “but”—in a
reverent tone—“I know that nothing which God sends upon
us, if it is rightly borne, can end in harm; nothing but our
own sins can do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“Did you feel that way <em>then</em>?” Tom asked, regarding the
young marquis with wonder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at first, perhaps, but it came to me after a little;
for, Tom, I had a good Christian mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, and so had I,” he replied, with a sigh that ended
in what sounded very like a sob. But Tom was not strong,
you know, and consequently more easily moved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She used to teach me that suffering was often blessing
in disguise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never heard that doctrine before, sir,” Tom returned,
looking down upon his emaciated hands, and thinking of
his bandaged limb, which was still very sore.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you would not think that the wound I gave
you, and the terrible sickness which has followed, were
blessings, would you, Tom?” Earle asked, with a smile, as
he noticed the look and divined his thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hardly that, sir, when my reason tells me how it is
all to end; but, sir, I’ll say this much, my own mother
couldn’t have been kinder, nor given me better care; and,
for the first time in my life, <em>I’ve learned what it is to trust a
man</em>!” he said, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Tom,” Earle returned, heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve no cause, sir. I should have killed you that night
if I had known you were there and awake, and then the
world would have lost a good man and gained another murderer.
Perhaps, looking at it in that way, sir, the wound
and the sickness were blessings in disguise, as you call them,”
he concluded, reflectively, and he shivered slightly as he
spoke, as if the thought of crime had acquired a strange
horror to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will not talk of this any more now,” Earle said, fearing
the excitement would be injurious to him. “I am only
too glad that your life was spared and I did not slay you,
even in self-defense. I am glad to know also that I have
gained your confidence; and I firmly believe that if you
should ever be free to go forth into the world again, you
would never lift your hand to harm me or mine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, sir; it is kind of you to say that,” was the
humble reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I want you to tell me something about your mother.
She must be quite old,” Earle continued, to change the
subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sixty last March, sir, and I haven’t seen her for twenty
years, though I’ve sent her enough to give her a good living
all that time. I used to—to—love my mother,” he concluded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>as if rather ashamed to make confession of a sentiment
so tender.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Used to, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ain’t fit to own to love for anybody now, sir! and it
would break her heart to know what I’ve been up to all
these years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At Farnham, in this county, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here in England! Why, that is only twenty-five or
thirty miles from here!” exclaimed Earle, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; and if I had made a good haul here, I was
going down to see her, and settle something handsome on
her,” he frankly confessed, but his face flushed, nevertheless,
at the acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wouldn’t you like to see her now?” asked Earle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I would, sir; and I suppose the poor old lady has
been worrying and wondering what’s happened to me, that
I did not send my usual letter and money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you send her money regularly?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle began to think there was a little green spot in the
man’s heart after all, and there might be some hope of reclaiming
him even yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Once in three months—sometimes more, sometimes less,
as my luck was, but always <em>something</em> as often as that,
though it’s six months now since she’s heard a word from
me, poor old lady,” he said, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you not tell me of this before? Your mother
should not be allowed to want,” Earle said, feeling a deep
interest in the lonely mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What right had I to burden you with my cares? You’ve
had more than enough of me as it is,” Tom replied, flushing
more deeply than he had yet done.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was evident that he felt his obligation to Earle was no
light one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle did not reply, and at that moment the door opened,
and a man entered bearing a large tray, covered with a
tempting array of viands that would have done the heart
of an epicure good.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must be hungry, Tom, after this long walk, so while
you are eating I will go away, as I have some letters to
write,” Earle said, rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom looked up at him with a troubled air, opened his
lips as if to speak, shut them again resolutely, and then
finally said, in a half-reckless, half-humble way:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can take my softness for what it’s worth, sir; I
couldn’t help it; but—I’d have been broken on the wheel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>before I’d have said as much to any one else. Tom Drake’s
known nothing but hard knocks for the last twenty years,
until a bullet laid him here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle went out of the room with a very grave face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I was only sure,” he murmured, with a deep-drawn
sigh, as he passed into the library and shut the door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLIII<br> <span class='large'>TRUE NOBILITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the end of two hours Earle went back to his charge,
with a letter in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom had been much refreshed by his nice dinner, and
had been asleep for an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he now lay with a troubled, anxious expression on
his face, which Earle could not fail to notice, even though
his lips relaxed into a faint smile of welcome at his entrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went up to the couch where he was reclining, and
said, as he handed him the letter:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would like, if you feel able, to have you direct this
letter to your mother, and after that you can read it, if you
like. I have thought best to write her something of your
illness, knowing that she must be very anxious at not hearing
from you for so long. I would gladly have done so
before had you spoken of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, sir,” Tom said, in a low voice, as, taking
the envelope and the pen filled with ink that Earle had
brought him, he directed the letter, in rather a trembling
hand. Then he unfolded it and read the few simple words
that were written within.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Madam</span>,” it said, “your son has been quite sick
during the past three months, and I write this that you may
feel no further anxiety regarding him. He is improving
daily, and will, we hope, soon be well. Should you feel
able to come to him, you will come directly to Wycliffe,
where you will be cordially received. Inclosed you will
find a sum which your son would have sent you before now
had he been able to write. Very truly,</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Earle Wayne</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A five-pound note had been inclosed within the letter, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the sight of which Tom Drake’s lips suddenly tightened
into a firm line.</p>

<p class='c007'>He read the letter through, and, when he had finished,
it dropped from his fingers upon the counterpane, and lay
there while he turned his face to the wall, and for some
minutes did not speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you do that for?” he at last demanded, almost
fiercely, but with lips that trembled in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To comfort an aged, anxious mother, and give a sick
fellow a chance to see a familiar face. You would surely
like to see your mother, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but it will be a little hard on the old lady when
she finds we’ll have to part again so soon,” he said, with a
stony look in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t think of that now,” Earle said, kindly. “Is there
anything more you would like me to add to the letter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom shook his head, and, picking up the letter and the
note, tried to replace them in the envelope, but his hand
shook so that he could not do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle gently took them from him, folded and sealed the
letter, and went out, leaving him alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>A groan burst from the huge chest of the once hardened
wretch as the door closed after him, and burying his head
in his pillow, he lay a long time without moving.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning he seemed very silent and much depressed.
It was a fine day, and Earle took him for a drive
in the beautiful park around Wycliffe.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not talk much, but appeared lost in thought,
until the horses’ heads were turned toward home; then he
astonished Earle by seizing his hand and bursting out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, can you believe a wretch like me has any heart left?
I didn’t think it myself, but you’ve got down to it at last.
I’ll plead guilty—though once I thought that ten thousand
devils couldn’t drive me to it; but you’ve broke me down
completely; I can never hold up my head again, and I deserve
the very worst they can give me I’d like it over
with and settled as soon as possible after <em>she</em> has been here.
She’ll not stay long, probably. I’m well enough not to be
a burden here any longer, and I’d feel easier in my mind to
know just what is before me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The poor fellow was frightfully pale, and so excited that
his sentences were disjointed and broken, and spoken through
teeth so tightly shut that Earle could hear them grate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young marquis was deeply affected; he had uttered
no fawning or servile protestations of sorrow or shame,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>asked for no mercy, expected none; but he could see that
he was, as he said “completely broken down;” his heart
had been melted by kindness, and little shoots of the original
good that was in him had begun to spring up in the unusual
atmosphere by which he had recently been surrounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle believed that a great and radical change was begun
in the man, and, if rightly dealt with now, he might be
saved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kindness had melted him; then why had he not a right
to feel that kindness would hold him and mold him anew?
His was undoubtedly one of those natures which grow
reckless and harden itself against everything like stern justice
and punishment, and only grow more desperate at the
thought of penalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>If tried and sentenced now for the attempt at robbery,
even though he might protest himself deserving of it, yet
he would go to his doom in dogged, sullen silence; nothing
would ever reach his better nature again, and he would
die as miserable as he had lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom,” Earle said, gravely, after a thoughtful silence,
during which these things had passed through his mind,
“from what you say, I judge that you regret your past
life, and, if you were to live it over again, you would spend
it very differently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Regrets won’t do me any good, and I don’t like to cry
for quarter when I’m only getting my just deserts,” he
said, with a kind of reckless bravery; then he added, with
a heavy sigh that spoke volumes: “But I think it would
be sort of comforting to a chap if he could look back and
feel that he’d <em>tried</em> to live like a—<em>man</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why not try to live like a ‘man’ in the future?”
Earle said, earnestly, his fine face glowing with a noble
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Transportation for life isn’t likely to give a body much
courage for anything,” the man answered, moodily, his face
hardening at the thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; and I hope no such evil will ever overtake you
to discourage you, if you really have a desire to mend your
course. Tom, you expect that I am going to arraign you before
a tribunal, and have you punished for the wrong you
have done me; but—I am going to do no such thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A gasp interrupted him at this, and Tom Drake sank
back in the carriage as if the intelligence had taken all his
strength; but Earle went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you had appeared to have no regret for the past—if,
as you gained in strength, you had exhibited no sorrow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>nor expressed any appreciation of what had been done for
you, or any desire to retrieve your errors, I might have
felt that it would be better for others that you should be
put where you could do no further mischief. But if you
really want to try to become a good man, I am willing to
help you. I will be your friend; I will give you employment
as soon as you are able for it, and as long as you
show a disposition to live aright, I will keep the secret of
your past, and no harm shall ever come to you on account
of it. Now tell me, Tom, if you are willing to make the
trial? Shall we start fair and square from this moment,
and see how much better we can make the world for having
lived in it?” and Earle turned to the astonished man
with a frank, kindly smile on his earnest, handsome face.
The man was speechless—dumb.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a proposal as this had never occurred to him. He
had fully expected that as soon as he should be able to bear
it he would be transferred from his present luxurious quarters
to some vile prison, there to await his trial, and then
he had no expectation of anything better than to be sentenced
to banishment as a convict for a long term of years,
or perhaps for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead, here was hope, happiness, and the prospects of
earning an honest living held out to him, and by the hand
of him whom he had so terribly wronged.</p>

<p class='c007'>No words came to his lips to express his astonishment,
nor the strange tumult of feelings that raged within his
heart. His whole soul bowed down before the grand nature
that could rise above his own injuries and do this noble thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tamora, Queen of the Goth, when suing for the life of
her first-born son, prayed thus before Titus Andronicus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?</div>
      <div class='line'>Draw near them, then, in being merciful;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet mercy is nobility’s true badge.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And thus Earle Wayne partook of the nature of the
gods; his mercy, his grand self-abnegation and forgiveness,
with the helping hand held out so kindly to one of earth’s
lost and degraded ones, was indeed the surest badge of his
nobility. And Marion Vance, in her meekness, had prophesied
truly when she had told him, on her dying bed, that
“good would come out of her sorrow.” She had said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may, perhaps, be a nobler man for having been
reared in obscurity; you will, at all events, realize that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>noble character is more to be desired than a mere noble-sounding
name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was now living out the pure precepts that she had so
untiringly taught him during those long, sorrowful years
when she was so sadly and uncomplainingly bearing her
banishment and disgrace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Drake dropped his face upon his hands to hide the
humility and reverence he could not speak, and the tears
he could not stay and was ashamed to show.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle Wayne’s enemy was utterly routed at last; he had
stormed a citadel by a method of warfare hitherto untried,
and it lay in ruins at his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I’m afraid I do not quite understand. You will not
have me arrested or tried—I am to be a free man?” Tom
Drake breathed, in low, suppressed tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; if you are sentenced to drag out a weary term of
years as a convict, you would become discouraged, and be
ready for almost any desperate deed if you should live to
return; and, Tom, I have come to believe that you would
really like to lead a different life from what your past has
been.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would, sir, I would; but I never should have thought
of it but for you—but for that bullet. It was indeed, as
you said, a ‘blessing in disguise,’” he said, weakly but earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle smiled his rare, luminous smile, then said, gravely:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will help you all I can; but you must do your
share also; it cannot be done in a moment, and you must
not get disheartened. It will be something like this wound
of yours; sin, like the bullet, has entered deep—the disease
lies deep, and only the most rigid and skilful handling, with
patient endurance, will work the cure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not preach him a long sermon on human depravity,
original sin, and the wrath of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>This little warning was all he then gave, hoping by practical
illustration to draw him by and by nearer to the Divine
Master whose commands he was endeavoring to obey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you—you make no account of anything? You forgive
all those three years—the harm to the girl? <em>How can
you?</em>” and the man lifted his earnest, wondering eyes to
the grand face at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Tom, I can forgive it all,” Earle said; but his face
grew pale and a trifle pained at the remembrance of all that
those words called up; “and I shall feel that the experience
was not in vain if <em>you</em> do not disappoint my expectations.
If you will faithfully and honestly strive to overcome whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>there is of evil within you, or whatever may tempt you
in the future, I shall feel that your character reclaimed is
the ‘good’ that has come out of my ‘sorrow.’ Tom, will you
strive to make an honest man, God’s noblest work, of yourself?
I want your promise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, from the bottom of my heart I’d <em>like</em> to be an honest
man, but—I’m afraid I can’t stand it,” he said, huskily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t stand what, Tom?” Earle asked, with a look of
perplexity and anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were the temptations and habits of the old life so strong
that he could not relinquish or overcome them?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel as if a millstone had crushed me; I’m afraid I
can’t stand it to face you day after day, with the memory
of all I’ve done staring me in the face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s face lighted—this was the best proof he had had
of the man’s sincerity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom, I want to tell you a little story; you will recognize
it, perhaps, as you say your mother is a Christian
woman. There was once a Man who was crushed beneath
the sins of a world. He wore a crown of thorns, and the
purple robe of scorn and derision. His tender flesh was
pierced, bruised, and mangled by His enemies, and His
only cry was, ‘Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do.’ There came a time when I realized that <em>my</em>
sins helped to do all this, and I felt something, as you
say, as if a ‘millstone had crushed me,’ and as if I could
never live in His presence with the memory of it ever in
my mind. But I read in His word, ‘Thy sins are remembered
no more against thee <em>forever</em>; they are <em>blotted out</em>.’
The same word tells me to ‘forgive as I am forgiven.’ Of
course we cannot actually forget all that we have suffered,
nor who was the immediate cause of it, but we can cherish
no evil—we can regard and treat as kindly those who have
injured us as if it had never been. That is the way I want
to ‘blot out’ all the past between you and me. Do you understand
me, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir,” Tom Drake said, in scarcely audible tones,
but his face was full of feeling and of an earnest purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I feel then, that I can trust you <em>fully</em> from this
hour?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may, sir,” very decidedly the reply came; and, after
a moment’s hesitation, he continued, in a resolute tone: “I’ll
not waste my breath nor weary you with promises; but, sir,
I’ll begin to <em>live</em> from this moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right; and here is my hand to seal our compact;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>and the young Marquis of Wycliffe grasped the hand
of poor degraded Tom Drake as heartily as if he had been
another peer of the realm.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had won an enemy—he had conquered a reckless, defiant
human heart, with neither sword nor spear, but by
the power of love and kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thrice blessed Marion Vance! Out of her sorrow had
grown her Christianity, out of her Christianity had grown
the education of this noble man, and out of his nobility the
salvation of another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who can estimate the mighty influence of a pure example
and faithful precepts?</p>

<p class='c007'>Did she, now looking down upon this scene, realize toward
what all the dark and winding path of her desolate life had
tended?</p>

<p class='c007'>She had learned to <em>trust</em> while here, where the way was
so dark that she could not see; and may we not hope that
faith had now ended in sight, and that the joy she had
missed on earth was increased a hundred fold in the better
world?</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither Earle nor his companion spoke again during the
remainder of their drive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Drake went immediately to his rooms when they
reached the house, and no one but himself and his Maker
knew how he passed that solitary hour that followed his
return.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle gave the reins to a groom, and went to the library
to see if there were any letters, but a servant met him on
the way and handed him a telegram that had just arrived.
It was a cable dispatch from the United States.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLV<br> <span class='large'>SUMNER DALTON’S CONFESSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The telegram was from Paul Tressalia, and extremely
startling and imperative in its nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton can live but a short time,” it said, “and begs
continually for you. Come at once. Editha also desires it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was deeply excited by what he read.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Sumner Dalton dying!—face to face at last with
the terrible messenger who, sooner or later, comes to summon
all!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>He was asking for <em>him</em>—longing for the son whom he
had wronged and hated all his life-long.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the moment Earle’s heart rebelled at the thought of
going to him; for if he went, he felt he must be prepared
to give him comfort in his last hours; he must be ready to
forgive everything—his own and his mother’s wrongs, and
be at peace with the man who was soon to stand before the
Supreme Judge to answer for his earthly career.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could he do this in all sincerity?</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood there in the grand hall of his ancestors, with
bent head and stern, corrugated brow, asking himself these
questions over and over again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the words that he had spoken only a little while
before to Tom Drake came to his mind:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forgive, <em>as</em> we are forgiven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was as if Marion’s gentle spirit, hovering over him,
had whispered the words in his ear—as if from the realms
of peace, where she dwelt, she had brought him an olive
branch to bear across the waters to the erring, dying one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go,” he said, at last, a pitiful expression replacing
the stern look, a grave though kindly light beaming
from his eyes. “I will go, and God help me to go in the
right spirit. Editha, too, desires it,” he repeated, reading
from the telegram, “and that of itself should make me
willing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And yet, much as he longed to see the beloved one once
more, he felt as if he could never endure a second parting
from her. Then graver thoughts presented themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Mr. Dalton should die, what would become of Editha?</p>

<p class='c007'>She had not a friend in the world on whom to depend;
would she feel that she could now return with him and
share his home?</p>

<p class='c007'>The matter troubled him deeply, and yet he clearly felt
that it would be his duty henceforth to protect and care
for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went into the library and consulted the papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>A steamer would sail the next day from London, and
he decided that he would go at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>He might not be in time to see Mr. Dalton alive, but
he would not delay; he would do his best to grant his
request, let the result be what it might.</p>

<p class='c007'>He disliked very much leaving Tom just at this time.
He knew that he depended upon him for encouragement,
and would doubtless be very much depressed, if not discouraged,
if he went away for any length of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it could not be helped, and the test might be beneficial.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>It would at all events teach him self-reliance, and
perhaps prove the man’s sincerity better than in any other
way.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went at once to him, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom, I am very unexpectedly called away. I am sorry
that it happened just at this time, but it cannot be helped.
Can you manage with only the servants for company until
your mother arrives?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; but will you be gone long?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know how long; I cannot fix any definite time
for my return, as it depends upon others rather than on
myself. You will be quite lonely, and I am sorry on your
account.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind me, sir; but—I hope it’s no trouble on <em>my</em>
account,” and he glanced anxiously at the telegram, which
Earle still had in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—oh, no. I may tell you, I suppose—it is more trouble
for Miss Dalton; her father is dying, and they have sent
for me,” Earle explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the United States, sir!” Tom exclaimed, in dismay,
and feeling as if some strong support was slipping from
under him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and I may have to be absent a month or two, perhaps
longer but you must try to make the best of it. Your mother
will probably arrive by to-morrow, and I would be glad if
she could remain with you until I return,” Earle said, thinking
his mother’s influence, and love, and care would be the
best guardians he could possibly leave in his absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, sir,” Tom answered, heartily then, after
thinking a moment, he added, wistfully: “I am getting strong
and well so fast that I would like to begin to do something,
sir. If you could leave me some work I should be glad, and
the time would not seem so long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle thought a moment, and then asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you good at accounts?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I used to be fair at them. I learned Comer’s method
after I went to America, thinking to make a business man
of myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then if you would take the trouble to straighten out
some accounts that got badly mixed during the last year
of the old marquis’ life, it would help me wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom’s face brightened at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should like it,” he said, eagerly; and Earle felt better
at once about leaving him, knowing that if he felt he was
making himself useful, he would be more contented.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day found him on board the Ethiopia, bound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>for New York, and scarcely able to control his impatience,
even though the noble steamer, with favorable wind and
weather, was plowing the pathless water with unusual speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of eight days he stood once more upon American
soil, and an hour or two later found him again ascending
the steps of Mr. Dalton’s residence.</p>

<p class='c007'>His hand trembled as he pulled the bell, and his heart beat
with heavy, painful strokes, so many memories, both sweet
and bitter, agitated him.</p>

<p class='c007'>A servant let him quietly in, and an ominous stillness at
once struck a chill to his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is Mr. Dalton living?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, but very low,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>He led him to the same little reception-room where he
had seen Editha on that day before Christmas, and where
she had given him that little bunch of holly, and wished
him, not the stereotyped “Merry Christmas,” but “peace,
good-will to men,” instead.</p>

<p class='c007'>It came to him now, that sweet message, with strange
vividness, and he grew suddenly calm and solemn as he
realized that he had indeed come with “peace” in his heart,
and “good-will” toward one who had been his life-long
enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>He gave his card to the servant, and then sat down to wait.
Would Editha come to greet him? he asked himself, and
would he be able to meet her as a brother should meet a
sister?</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifteen minutes elapsed, and then a door softly opened
again. Earle turned, his heart leaping to his throat, but
it was not Editha.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw a strange but noble-looking woman coming toward
him, and wondered to see her there.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed courteously, but she cordially extended her
hand, as her eyes sought his card, which the servant had
given her, and upon which was simply engraven the two
names he had always borne. He made no display of his
title, nor of his new position.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Wayne,” she said, “we hardly expected you to-day;
but I am very glad you have arrived. My name is
Sylvester, and I am the only one at liberty to come to you
just now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle returned her greeting, wondering who Mrs. Sylvester
could be—certainly not the housekeeper, for her manner
and bearing forbade him to believe that she occupied
that position; and he had heard Editha say they had no near
relatives living.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>She might be some friend or neighbor come in to relieve
her and share her lonely vigils, he thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>He inquired if Miss Dalton was well, and noticed that
a queer little smile wreathed the lady’s lips, as she replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha is quite well, and is sleeping just now. Mr.
Dalton had an extremely distressing night, and she would
persist in sitting up with him until nearly morning. The
poor darling has been unremitting in her care, and is nearly
worn out,” Mrs. Sylvester concluded, speaking with great
tenderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle then inquired concerning Mr. Dalton’s illness and
its cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a long, long story, and I will leave it for Editha
to tell you when she wakes, and you are rested. I will only
say that it was brought on by excessive excitement, during
which he ruptured a blood vessel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle expressed great surprise at this, and madam continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“He recovered somewhat from the first attack of bleeding,
and we were hoping his recovery would be permanent,
when he had another, since which he has been rapidly failing.
As soon as he became conscious that he could not
live, he seemed to be exceedingly troubled regarding some
injury which he had done you, and wished you sent for
immediately. He will be much relieved to know of your
arrival, for he has been very restless and anxious ever
since Mr. Tressalia sent the telegram.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there no possible hope of his recovery?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; there is not the slightest hope of that. The physician
does not think he can live many days. Now, if you
will excuse me, I will go and see if he feels able to see you,
as he wished to be told the moment you arrived,” madam
concluded, rising, and with a graceful bow, left him once
more alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had not been gone many minutes when a servant entered,
bearing a tray, on which was arranged a most tempting
lunch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madam directed this to be served,” explained the servant;
and again Earle wondered who this cultivated woman
could be, who was evidently a power in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>He partook of the lunch, however, with evident relish, for
he was hungry, having been too eager and excited to do
justice to his breakfast that morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour later madam returned, saying that Mr. Dalton
was ready and anxious to see him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>He arose and followed her to the sick man’s chamber, and
almost wondering if it could be true that he was about
to stand at his own father’s death-bed, and if ever before
a son stood in such strange relations toward a parent.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was shocked at the change in Mr. Dalton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ghastly, wan, and panting with every breath, he lay bolstered
up with pillows, and Earle knew at a glance that
he could not live many days.</p>

<p class='c007'>An expression of pain convulsed his features as the door
opened and his anxious eyes rested upon the young man’s
handsome face and noble form; and then, with a slight
motion of his head, he signified his wish for him to come and
sit beside him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a strange, sad meeting of a father and son.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one so strong and manly, and in full vigor of life;
the other pale, emaciated, and dying, and neither experiencing
nor expressing any natural regard for the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s humanity was touched as soon as he saw the
sufferer. He forgot all his past bitterness, he forgot that
this was one who claimed to be an implacable foe, who had
said he “hated him and all that ever belonged to him.” He
only thought of him now as a sick and dying man who
needed sympathy and care.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did not expect when you went away that when
next we met you would find your enemy laid so low, did
you?” Mr. Dalton asked, in a hollow voice, when Earle
was seated, and searching his face with a keen glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have never wished you any ill, sir,” he replied, respectfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot say the same regarding you, for there was
nothing I would not have done, for the sake of the hatred
I bore your mother, to have hurled you from the proud
position you occupy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall we not drop all this now and forever?” Earle
interrupted, gently, fearing he would become excited if this
topic was renewed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I must have my say out now. I’ve been saving
my strength for this, and I have much to tell you, and the
sooner it is over with, the better for me. One’s sentiments
change when a body feels life slipping from his grasp, and
I felt that I would like you to know before I die that I
realize at last, instead of injuring others only, I have been
my own worst enemy. I don’t know <em>why</em> I should always
have hated others for what has really been my own fault;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>for all through my life my folly has been the cause of all
my disappointments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have seen a child get angry with his toys—his top
or his ball, when it would not spin or bound as he wished
it—and vent his anger by destroying them, when it was
only his own lack of judgment and skill that prevented his
enjoying them. I suppose it was that same trait in me,
only in tenfold degree, that has made me wish to destroy
every one who opposed or disappointed me in my schemes
or ambition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused a moment, and Earle watched him curiously.
He had never heard anything so strange before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Had I lived for ten, twenty, or even forty years more,
I suppose I should have gone on in the same way,” Mr.
Dalton resumed. “I suppose as long as I knew you were
enjoying the position and possessions I had so coveted, I
should have continued to hate you, and striven to do you
injury. But my hatred can do you no further harm now,
nor me any good where I am going; neither money nor
position, the two things that I have most coveted all my
life, can benefit me further. I have never believed in a
God, have tried to believe that man was like the brutes,
and consequently must get all the enjoyments possible out
of this life; but now that I have come to this”—lifting his
wasted hand and regarding it with a strange expression of
wonder, and perplexity, and regret—“I do not feel quite so
confident that God and eternity are not solemn truths. That
the mind is something greater than the body, and will probably
exist in another state, I am at last convinced; but
I have no time to discuss metaphysics now. My life has
been a failure, for I have missed <em>everything</em> for which I
sought most eagerly. I have never known what it is to be
really happy. I have done a great deal of evil, and I do
not know a single human being that is better for my having
lived in the world. The only good thing that I can think
of connected with myself is, that no one will sorrow or be
made unhappy by my death;” and the smile that accompanied
these words was intensely bitter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have told you how I disliked you from the first, simply
because Richard Forrester was interested in you, and I
was jealous of any one who was likely to win anything from
him. You know how I scorned you because Editha took a
girlish fancy to you, and you dared to treat her as if you
considered yourself her equal. I was so angry that day in
court that I could have blotted you out of existence had I
possessed the power, and throttled her when she stood up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>so fearlessly in that crowded room and asserted your innocence.
I was afraid she would learn to love you, and
persist in marrying you. I knew that Richard Forrester was
rich, and that she would have all his money; but I meant
she should get more, by making a wealthy marriage. The
more <em>she</em> had, the more I thought <em>I</em> should have, and stand
the higher in the world for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again he paused to rest, and Earle would have been glad
if he would cease entirely. He knew all this, and he could
not see the good of its all being rehearsed, neither could he
understand toward what it was drifting; but he was soon to
know, and a great surprise awaited him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When Richard Forrester died,” he began again, “and
left you that ten thousand dollars, I vowed you should not
have it, for I felt sure it would give you a start in life,
and you would want to marry Editha. I was bound she
should wed a rich man, and I would not be thwarted. Then
I made the discovery of who you were; and if your sentence
had been for life, I would not have lifted my finger to
have had it mitigated in the slightest degree. I seemed to
gloat over the fact that Marion’s son, the son of the woman
whose high spirit had prevented me from reaching the
goal I sought, was thus disgraced, and, not knowing that
she was dead, I thought I could imagine some of her sufferings
on account of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not wonder that you shudder,” he said, seeing a
quiver of pain run over Earle’s body at this heartless speech;
“and I can see now just how such fiendish malice appears
to others. If I had known, however, that <em>my</em> marriage with
Marion had been legal, you may be sure I should have
adopted a very different course. If, when from motives of
curiosity I opened that package belonging to you, I had discovered
those papers in the cardboard pocket, my ambition
and selfishness would have prompted me to court the favor
of the heir of Wycliffe. But I did <em>not</em> know, and when you
told me, and refused to let me share your honors, my ire
increased tenfold, and I vowed I would make you suffer
for it in some way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s face was very grave and pale as he listened, and
it seemed as if he was almost living over again the troubles
he had been through, to be reminded of them in this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was only <em>one</em> way that I could do this,” Mr.
Dalton said, with a troubled glance at the white, set face
by his side, “and that was through Editha. You loved her,
and she loved you, and I gloated over the fact that through
her I could make you miserable, though you stood on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>very pinnacle of where I had longed to climb, <em>and even
though I sacrificed her in so doing</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle’s lips twitched nervously at this, and, had not the
man before him been helpless and dying, his indignation
must have burst forth at this startling and inhuman statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dalton noticed his emotion, and his lips curled in a
bitter smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One is not often allowed the privilege of reading such
a page of heart-history as I am turning for you to-day;
one does not often meet a <em>father</em> who could cherish such
bitterness and antagonism toward his only son, and so utterly
devoid of natural affection also for the child whom
he has reared from infancy; but I will make no half-confession—I
want you to know just how black my record
has been, and then I will make what restitution there is in
my power.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With all my other sins, I had a secret that I had kept
for more than twenty years, and expected it would die with
me. I did not believe there was a soul living who knew
aught of it, or who could ever discover it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there was; justice was on my track, and, like an
avenging Nemesis, pursued me with a relentless determination.
I fled, I hid, I vowed I would not be thwarted out of
<em>every</em> scheme I had formed, but all to no purpose, and one
day I was brought face to face with a foe, of whose existence
I had not dreamed until only a short time before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Foiled at every point, my last weapon wrested from me,
I lost all control of myself, and in my anger and mortification
ruptured a blood vessel in the lungs, and knew that
my days were numbered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was not a pleasant thing to know that death had
set his mark upon me, and for awhile I tried to fight the
conviction; but it was of no use, and then I began to
think; and one has very different ideas regarding the end
and aim of man, when ‘Death sits grinning his horrible,
ghastly smile upon him,’ than when in the full vigor of
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like two vivid pictures, your life and mine arose up
before me—my own, full of pride, ambition, and selfishness,
with no principle of truth or goodness in it, and
ending in utter wreck; yours, in the face of mountain-like
difficulties, filled with the beauty of high resolves, noble
purposes, and unwavering rectitude and nobility, not the least
of which was the fact that even while smarting beneath
the fiercest strokes of your enemy, you did not cease to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>be generous—that ten thousand dollars, with all my arrogance
and bravado, has lain heavy on my conscience ever
since you made it over to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am nearly done. I could not rest—I could not die
until I had told you all this. I do not ask you to forgive
me; the words would seem but mockery to you. The purity
of your life, standing out in such bold relief against the
blackness of mine, enraged me. If I could have seen you
angry—if I could really have found a flaw in you—perhaps
I should not have always been so bitter. I say it always
angered me, until I was obliged to lie here and think. Now
it shames me, and I would be glad if I could annihilate from
<em>your</em> memory the shame of having had such a father. I
cannot make any atonement for the past to either you or
Editha. I can only wish that your future may be as full of
happiness as you both deserve, and perhaps I may be able
to contribute a trifle to it by being the first to tell you that
<em>Editha is not my child at all</em>!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLV<br> <span class='large'>MADAM SYLVESTER’S STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Earle nearly bounded from his seat at this startling intelligence,
and then, controlling himself for the sake of the
sick man, sank back into his chair with a low, suppressed
cry, his face almost as colorless as that of the dying man’s
upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha not your child!” he said at last, in a strained,
unnatural voice, his heart beating with great heavy throbs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; not a drop of my blood flows in her veins,” Mr.
Dalton panted.</p>

<p class='c007'>His strength was all gone, now that his story was told,
and it was with difficulty that he spoke at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s child is she, then?” Earle asked, trembling with
eagerness, a glad gleam leaping into his eyes in spite of
his sad surroundings and his sympathy for the panting form
upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam Sylvester now came to the bedside.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had entered so quietly a few moments before that
neither Earle nor Mr. Dalton was aware of her presence
until this moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dalton must rest now; he is nearly exhausted,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>said, adding: “I will summon the nurse, and as Editha
is still sleeping, and you are doubtless anxious to have
the mystery explained, I will finish the story of Editha’s
parentage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle instantly arose, and a sudden thought made him
glance at her more keenly than he had yet done; then,
with a look of sympathy at the panting sufferer, he turned
to follow her. Mr. Dalton had seen that look, however,
and it stirred his soul to its very depths.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached out his wasted hand as if to stay him, and
said, weakly, while his features writhed in pain:</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good father might have been proud to own you as
his son. As it is, I cannot even ask you to take my hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle turned quickly and bent over him, his manly face
softened to almost womanly tenderness and beauty—not
from the dawn of any filial affection! that could not be,
after all the bitter past—but from pity and compassion for
a soul standing alone upon the brink of eternity, with nothing
to lean upon as he entered the dark valley of the shadow
of death, and no hope in the mysterious future toward
which he was hastening.</p>

<p class='c007'>As his humanity would have prompted him to reach out
his strong right hand to save either friend or foe in case of
danger, so his grand nature yearned to lead this darkened
mind into the light of hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will not talk of the past any more,” he said, gently;
“It is gone, and it is vain to dwell upon it. The future is
what we must think of now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The future—my future! What will it be like, I wonder?”
Sumner Dalton asked, helplessly, and searching that
noble face with painful earnestness, as if he could tell him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The future means ‘heaven’ to those who are ready for
it,” was the grave, dignified reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes; but to those who are <em>not</em> ready for it?” came
breathlessly from the blue lips of the sufferer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>All may</em> be ready for it if they will,” Earle answered,
in low, sweet tones. Then seeing how excited Mr. Dalton
was becoming, he added: “You must rest now—you have
talked long, and are very weary. I will come to you again
when you have slept, and we will talk more of this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will stay—you will not go away until—after——”
the dying man began, wildly, but finished with a groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thought of death was anguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall stay for the present—as long as you need me,”
Earle replied, understanding him, and pitying him deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sigh of relief followed this assurance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>In the hour of his weakness and need he turned, with a
strange feeling of confidence, to the strong, true nature
which he had once so scorned and despised.</p>

<p class='c007'>His eyes followed the manly form wistfully as it quietly
passed from the room, then, with a weary sigh, he turned
upon his pillow and slept.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam Sylvester led Earle back to the room where she
had first met him, and motioning him to a chair, took one
herself near him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you are anxious to see Editha,” she said; “but
she is not yet awake. I peeped into her room on my way
to Mr. Dalton’s, and the dear child has not moved since
I looked in before. She was nearly worn out this morning
when she went to rest. Now I will do as you say—leave this
interesting story for her to finish, or relieve your suspense
and tell you myself while she sleeps,” she added, with her
charming manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me by all means,” Earle said, earnestly. “I cannot
endure the suspense, and I am utterly amazed by Mr.
Dalton’s last statement to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not to be wondered at, and your amazement probably
will not end there. Your query, when he told you
Editha was not his child, very naturally was, ‘Whose is she,
then?’ My lord, <em>I am Editha’s mother</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle looked the astonishment that he could not express,
and yet the shadow of suspicion of this had crossed his
mind just before leaving Mr. Dalton’s room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never believed anything would ever again give me
such joy as this knowledge does,” Earle said, with a deep-drawn
sigh of thankfulness, and beginning to realize something
of the joy that might be in store for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, no longer regarded as a sister, might now be
claimed as a wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam smiled. She greatly admired the handsome young
marquis, and her heart was very light to know of the brilliant
future that lay before her beautiful daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It gives me pleasure to hear you say that,” she said.
“And now, if you have patience, I will tell you my sad
story and all regarding Editha’s parentage, as I have already
related it to her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have patience,” Earle said, smiling; and madam began:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nearly twenty-three years ago I met with the saddest
loss that ever falls to the lot of woman—the loss of a love
that would have brightened all my future life. From my
early girlhood I had an affection for my own cousin, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>was beloved in return by him. As we grew older that
affection increased, until at the age of eighteen I was betrothed
to him. Soon after, he went to sea, hoping on
his return to be able to make me his wife. He had a share
in a trading-vessel, and, if they made a successful voyage,
he hoped to realize a handsome sum, which, with what he
already had, would enable him to support a wife. Three
months later came the news of the loss of the vessel, and his
name was among the list of those who perished. Our engagement
had been a secret, and so it was only in secret
that I could mourn. In the presence of others, of course,
I must appear the same as usual, and so, to hide the grief
that was burning my heart to ashes, I assumed a reckless
gayety that deceived every one. About this time a stranger
appeared in our circle. He was wealthy, fascinating, and
very handsome. He appeared attracted by my beauty, as my
friends were pleased to term my good looks, and paid me
much attention. My family were pleased with him, I liked
him, and when he offered me marriage I accepted him, thinking
that perhaps, under new excitement and change of scene
and country, I might find some balm for my wounded heart.
We were married, and spent several months in traveling,
and then contrary to my expectations my husband preferred
to remain indefinitely in Paris, and we set up a home of
our own in the suburbs of the city. Before the end of a
year a little child was given to us—a blue-eyed, golden-haired
daughter, whom we both loved with almost idolatrous
affection, and it seemed as if Heaven had at last sent
healing to my sore spirit, for I became calmly and quietly
happy; my acute grief had passed, and, though my deepest
affection was in the ocean grave of my sailor lover, yet
I looked forward to a future of quiet happiness with the
new ties that bound me to life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My baby—Editha we had named her—was only three
months of age, when one day, as my husband and I were
watching her as she lay crowing and laughing in her cradle,
the door behind us opened and some one entered the room.
We both turned, and saw a form gaunt and trembling, a face
pale and wasted, but dearer than life to me. It was Louis
Villemain, my lost lover, whom I believed lying cold in
death at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was young, impulsive, and not yet strong after the
birth of my child, and the shock was more than I could
bear. With one wild cry of joy, I sprang forward and threw
myself upon his bosom, forgetting that I was already a wife
and a mother, forgetful of my husband’s presence—of everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>save that Louis was alive and had returned. I murmured
fond, wild words of love and delight, words which a
wife has no right to speak save in the ear of her husband,
and mine, sitting there, listened horror-struck, and learned
the whole. It was only when, exhausted with my joy, I lay
weeping on Louis’s bosom that I was at last aroused to a
consciousness of what I had done, by my husband’s stern
sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What may be the meaning of this exceedingly affecting
scene, allow me to ask?’ he said, hissing the words between
his teeth; and then with a shriek I realized our
relative positions, and fell fainting to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I need not dwell upon what followed,” madam said,
with a sigh, “when I came to myself, Louis was gone, and
my husband, angry and wretched at discovering how he
had been deceived, was very unreasonable, and poured forth
such a storm of jealous wrath upon me that I was nearly
crushed. I confessed everything to him then, I pleaded my
sorrow and weakness, and implored his forgiveness and
mercy, but he denounced me as an unfaithful wife, at least
at heart, and vowed that from that day we should live as
strangers, and yet, for our child’s sake, every outward
propriety must be observed. I was more wretched than I
can express, and very unwisely poured forth my troubles
into Louis’s ear, when he came the next day and sought
me alone. I could not deny that the old love was stronger
than the new, and the future looked like darkest gloom to
me—my husband’s respect and confidence gone—my lover
returned to look reproach upon me from sad and hollow
eyes, and my conscience constantly upbraiding me for having
married a good and noble man when I had no heart to
give him. I felt like a forsaken thing, and, always morbidly
sensitive, I was tenfold more so then in my weakened,
nervous state. I do not pretend to excuse my sin—I can only
tell it just as it happened. Louis, as wretched as myself,
comforted me with the old, tender words that he used
to speak, and, bemoaning my sad fate in being linked to
such a cruel husband, urged me to fly with him on a new
vessel that he was to command, and be happy in our own
way. The vessel was to sail in a few days, and with
passionate eloquence he pictured the delight of the free, beautiful,
roving life we would lead. I consented, and one day,
when my husband was absent for a few hours, I took my
baby and fled. Louis had gone on before me, and was
to meet me at the seaport town from which the vessel was to
sail. Not being able to leave home until afternoon, I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>obliged to stop over night at a small town about half way
from the port. I was more lonely than I can tell you, as
alone and unprotected I retired and lay with my baby in my
arms, thinking of what I had done. I thought of my dead
mother and her early teachings—of the words she used to
love and repeat from the sacred book, and the earnestness
with which she used to impress their meaning upon me, and
the horror and guilt of the step I was contemplating overwhelmed
me. My baby awoke at midnight, and would not
be coaxed to sleep again; so, lighting the candle, I lay there
and watched her play, and talk, and coo in her charming
little way. Every now and then she would stop, look around
the room as if she knew she was in a strange place, and
then glance up at me with great serious eyes that seemed
to question my conduct and reproach my rashness. I thought
of my husband, who, though he had been hasty and somewhat
cruel in his reproaches, was yet a good, true man. I pictured
the despair he would feel when he should return and
find his wife and child gone, his home desolate, his name
dishonored, and all the horror of my rash act rushed with
overwhelming force upon me. I threw myself upon my
knees beside my bed and wept out my repentance there, resolving
that early morning should find me returning like
the prodigal to my home. I acted upon that resolve, first
dispatching a note to Louis telling him of my resolution, and
entreating him not to come to me again, nor seek to hold
any communication with me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reached home at noon the next day, but my husband
had already discovered my flight. I suppose I might have
told him some story—that I had only been to visit a friend
in my loneliness, or something of that kind, and he might
have accepted it; but I did not; I went to him and confessed
the whole, imploring his pardon, and swearing fidelity for
the future. I think if he could have had time to think it
over and consider the matter, he would have acted differently;
but his heart was already too sore to bear more, and
his naturally fierce temper swept all reason before it. He
took my baby from my arms and bade me ‘go,’ refusing to
believe I had not flown <em>with</em> Louis instead of to him. I
prayed him to leave my child, my beautiful, blue-eyed, fair-haired
Editha, but he told me I was not a fit mother to rear a
child, and he refused me even the comfort of a parting
caress. He said hard, cruel things to me in that fit of passion—words
that broke my heart, seared my brain, and
drove me nearly crazed from the sight of every familiar face.
I never saw him again—I never heard aught of him for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>long, long years. After I had recovered somewhat from
the first shock of my wild grief I began to reason with
myself. I knew I had sinned deeply—I had committed a
great wrong in marrying one man when my heart was another’s,
even though I believed that other dead, and I had
enhanced that wrong a hundred fold in yielding to Louis’
persuasions and consenting to fly with him. True, I had
repented before it was too late to turn back, but it was a
bitter blow to my husband; it was an act of treachery, and
I could not blame him for his first wild outbreak. But
I felt that it was cruel in him to be so relentless when I
had confessed all; if he had but been merciful—if he could
but have consented to give me a place at his hearth-stone
until he had tested my sincerity, I feel that a comparatively
happy life might have eventually been ours. I wrote to him
times without number, begging him to let me come and be the
faithful wife and mother I knew I was capable of being; but
he never returned me one word in reply—never told me
aught of my child, over whom my heart has yearned as only
a mother’s heart can yearn for her only darling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A short time after our separation I received a letter
from Louis telling me of his marriage with an Italian lady,
and begging me to forgive him for the wrong he had done
me in tempting me from my duty as a wife. A year later
news of his death reached me, and then I sought my brother,
the only living relative I then had. He received me kindly,
and has devoted himself to my comfort and happiness ever
since, and we have lived for each other and for the good
we could do to others who have suffered and sinned. I have
had much of peace—I have even known something of happiness,
since no one can relieve the wants of others and
witness their comfort and gratitude without being blessed for
the good wrought. But I am wearying you with my long
story,” madam said, stopping, with a sad smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; it is thrillingly interesting, but so sad,” Earle said,
longing to hear the remainder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall soon finish now. I told you, I believe, that my
husband was an American, did I not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; is it possible?” Earle exclaimed, greatly surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and for years I have longed to come to the United
States to visit his native land, hoping that by some chance
I might glean some news of him and my child. My brother
and I visited the place that used to be his home, but he had
been gone from there for many years. After the death of
his parents he had removed to some city, but no one could tell
us where, and no one knew anything of his having a child,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>and were even surprised to learn that he had ever been
married. We could trace him no farther, and I gave up all
hope, believing that my child must have died before it
reached this country, and so he had never owned the fact
of his marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We thought we might as well visit some of the points
of interest here before returning home, and it was while at
Newport that I found Editha.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely you could not have recognized her after so many
years?” Earle said, thinking she meant to imply that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, although we were both strongly attracted to
each other at once. She was ill; she had seen sorrow something
akin to mine—that I knew as soon as I looked into
her sad eyes—and just as I had discovered its nature, and
was seeking a better acquaintance with her, she and her
father suddenly disappeared from Newport. I learned
through Mr. Tressalia that they had gone to Saratoga, and,
being determined to know something more of her, and
wishing also to visit Saratoga, we followed them thither.
Immediately upon our appearance Mr. Dalton became
strangely excited, and behaved in the most unaccountable
manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We arrived at night, while they were at a garden-party.
We went to seek them, and, after a short interview, Editha
and Mr. Dalton withdrew. Early the next morning, before
any of us had arisen, they had departed, leaving no trace
behind them as to their destination.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha! Mr. Dalton must have had some suspicion of who
you were, and, for reasons of his own, desired to keep the
knowledge from Editha,” exclaimed Earle, getting really
excited over this strange history.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVI<br> <span class='large'>“WHAT A STRANGE STORY!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Did you ever meet Mr. Dalton before?” Earle asked, excusing
himself for his involuntary interruption.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, never; but I will soon explain how he recognized
me, though I should never have known anything of him—should
never have found my child even then, had it not
been for your cousin, Paul Tressalia,” replied madam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor Paul!” Earle sighed, thinking how his hopes were
doomed to be blighted at every turn.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“Mr. Tressalia has suffered deeply,” madam returned, “but
he is rising above it nobly. I really believe if it had not been
for his kind and judicious care of Editha after he returned
to Newport, she would have sunk into a decline. He bravely
renounced all his hopes of winning her, when she told him
that she could never love another, and devoted himself to
cheering her, and no one has expressed himself more truly
glad over these recent discoveries than your noble cousin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a truly brave man, and deserves a better fate than
has overtaken him just in the prime of his life,” Earle said,
regretfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A ‘better fate’ will yet come to him, I feel sure, and
his life will yet be rounded and completed by the hand of
One who knows best how to fashion the lives He has given
us,” madam answered, with grave thoughtfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I told you,” she continued, after a moment, “on our
arrival at Saratoga, we repaired immediately to the garden-party,
and while there I managed to draw Editha one side
for a little quiet chat, during which she opened her heart to
me. I had heard something of her sad story from Mr.
Tressalia before, but she related it to me more fully. She
spoke of her uncle several times, telling of his deep interest
in you, of his fondness for her, and that he had, in dying,
bequeathed all his fortune to her, save the sum he had wished
you to have. I casually inquired his name, but before she
could reply, Mr. Dalton interrupted us and took Editha away.
The next morning I arose quite early, considering the lateness
of the hour that I had retired the night previous, feeling
very restless, and apprehensive of I know not what.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I met Mr. Tressalia in a small sitting-room as I went
below, and immediately began talking of the conversation
I had had with Editha the night before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What was Miss Dalton’s uncle’s name—the one who
left her his fortune?’ I asked, during the interview.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Richard Forrester,’ he returned; and I sank into a chair,
feeling as if a heavy hand had suddenly been laid upon
my heart and stopped its beating.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will not wonder,” madam continued, her face paling
with emotion even then at the remembrance, “when I tell
you that <em>Richard Forrester was my husband</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your husband!” repeated Earle, fairly dazed with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my husband, and Editha’s father. I saw through
it all in an instant. Mr. Dalton’s wife was his sister, and
to her he had committed his child. It was no wonder that
I had been attracted toward her from the very first; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>was no wonder that, when I met her for the first time in
Redwood Library at Newport, my heart thrilled with something
stronger than sympathy for her sorrow and pity for
her suffering. She was my own, own child, and it was
the instinct of the mother claiming her offspring, even before
she recognized her. She was my baby, my pet, my
little bud of promise, which had been so cruelly wrested
from my arms more than twenty years before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And madam’s tears flowed freely even now. Her joy was
so new that she could not speak of it without weeping.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a strange, strange story!” Earle exclaimed. “Richard
Forrester Editha’s father! That accounts, then, for
the intense love which he always seemed to bear her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did love her, then—he did not visit her mother’s sin
upon the life of her child?” madam asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed; he seemed to love her most devotedly. She
never came into his presence but that his eyes followed
her every movement with a strange, intense gaze, at which
I often wondered. But I cannot understand why he should
have resigned his claim upon her—why he denied himself
all the comfort of her love, and had her reared as Sumner
Dalton’s child,” Earle said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will understand it as I go on,” madam returned,
wiping her tears. “Of course, after that discovery, I was
nearly wild to claim my child, and Mr. Tressalia went at
once to arouse Mr. Dalton and demand a full explanation
of all the past in my behalf. You can imagine something
of our consternation when he discovered that he had departed
on an early train, taking Editha with him, and no
one could tell us whither they had gone. We returned to
Newport, thinking they might have gone back there, but
they were not there. Mr. Tressalia said that Mr. Dalton
had visited Long Branch the previous summer, and possibly
we might find them there; so to Long Branch we repaired,
but with the same success. We visited one or two other
watering-places with a like result, and then returned to New
York, thinking we might find them at home; but their house
was closed, and we knew not which way to turn then. But
I was desperate. The fact of Sumner Dalton’s flying from
me would have alone convinced me that Editha was my child
if nothing else had, and I was determined I would never give
up the chase until I found her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last we discovered that they were boarding quietly
at a hotel, and one morning while seated in their private
parlor, Mr. Dalton reading, Editha sewing, we walked in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>upon them unannounced, beyond a light knock upon their
door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The look upon Mr. Dalton’s face upon beholding us was
a strange one—it was amazement, rage, and despair combined,
while Editha immediately sprang forward with a
cry of joy to welcome us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am unable to account for this intrusion,’ Mr. Dalton
said, loftily, and instantly recovering his self-possession.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I can explain it in a very few words,’ I returned, calmly.
‘I have come to claim my child!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I do not understand you,’ he answered, with well-feigned
surprise, but growing white as a piece of chalk at my words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You do understand me, Mr. Dalton,’ I said, sternly, ‘and
you know that I speak the truth when I claim this dear girl
as my child and Richard Forrester’s.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I turned to clasp her in my arms, but she had sunk, white
and trembling, into a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I should like to see your proofs of that statement,’ Mr.
Dalton sneered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not reply, but bending down, I took both of Editha’s
hands in mine, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear child, tell me the date of your birth.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Editha, I command you to hold no communication with
that woman,’ Mr. Dalton cried, shaking from head to foot
with passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha looked from one to the other in helpless amazement
for a moment; then she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Surely, papa, it can do no harm for me to give the
date of my birth,’ then fixing her eyes wistfully on my
face, and with lips that quivered painfully, she added, ‘I
was born October 24th, 1843.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child and Richard Forrester’s—my little blue-eyed,
fair-haired girl, that her father named Editha for the happiness
she brought him—was born October 24th, 1843.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My love, did no one ever tell you that you resembled
Richard Forrester?’ I asked, gathering her close in my arms,
for I knew she was mine, and I would never relinquish
her again, unless, after hearing my story, she should refuse
to acknowledge me as her mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, it was often remarked,’ she returned; ‘but mamma
always said it was not strange since Uncle Richard was her
brother.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Not “Uncle Richard” any longer, my darling,’ I said,
‘but your own father.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My father! and you were his wife—you are my mother?’
she said, studying my face, and trembling in every nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>“‘It is a falsehood! Editha, leave the room instantly,
and I will deal with these people myself. Go, I say; that
woman is no fit companion for my daughter!’ Mr. Dalton
shouted, and strode toward me, his hands clenched and
his face blazing with fury.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whatever his intentions were, he never reached me, for
the blood all at once gushed from his mouth, and he fell
fainting to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course everything was at once forgotten in the confusion
that followed and the alarm occasioned by his condition.
He had a very violent hemorrhage, and the doctor
gave very little hope of his rallying; but his constitution
was strong, and after a couple of weeks he began to gain
strength and flesh, and the physicians then said, with the
exercise of great care he might live for a good while.
Meantime, Editha and I clung to each other with all the
fondness and delight it is possible for a long-parted mother
and child to experience. There was no doubt in our own
minds that we belonged to each other, although Mr. Dalton
was still very sullen and morose on the subject, and would
confess nothing. But one day he was attacked with another
bleeding turn, so severe that we all knew he could not live
long, and he seemed conscious himself that he could not rally
from it. Then he seemed willing to talk upon the subject so
fraught with interest to us all. Editha sought him one day,
and begged him to tell her all the truth. Then he confessed
that it was all as I had supposed, and that the moment
he saw me at Newport he knew me from a picture that he
had once seen in Mr. Forrester’s possession. He said that
when my husband returned from Europe with his little child
he took her directly to his sister, who had no children, and
begged her to adopt it as her own. He told all the story of
his marriage and the sad events which followed it, and said
he never wished his child to know that any sorrow was connected
with her early life; he wished her to grow up happy
and free from all care, and he would gladly forego the comfort
of calling her his own, that no shadow need ever come
upon her. In return for the consent of Mr. and Mrs. Dalton
to adopt her, he settled upon them fifty thousand dollars,
and promised them that Editha should have all his fortune
if she outlived him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His reason told him that Richard Forrester would gladly
have absolved him from all promise of secrecy regarding her
birth, rather than that her life should be ruined, as it was
likely to be upon discovering that you were his son; but his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>enmity toward you made him prefer to sacrifice her happiness
rather than forego his revenge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a disposition for a person to cherish! It is beyond
my comprehensions,” Earle said, gravely, and thinking sorrowfully
of the dying man upstairs, whose whole life had
been ruined by giving the rein to his evil passions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would seem, too, as if there ought to have been some
natural instinct in his heart that would at least have prevented
him from doing you such despite, even if he bore
you no love,” madam returned. “But, as he says,” she added,
“he has been his own worst enemy—out of his own folly
alone have sprung all his misfortunes and disappointments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is true, and is it not often proved that those who
seek to wrong others only injure themselves the most in the
end?” Earle asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is, indeed,” madam returned, sadly; then she said,
rising: “I believe I have told you all now. I think Editha
must be awake by this time. I will go and tell her of your
arrival. You will find her a little worn and pale perhaps,
but not a whit less lovely than she was a year ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam’s smile was full of beauty and tenderness whenever
she spoke of her newly-found daughter, and Earle
thought she was a very handsome woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>She left the room, and he sat thinking over all the strange
incidents of the past six years—yea, all the strange incidents
of his whole life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story he had just listened to seemed wonderful to
him. He could scarcely credit the good news that was to
blot out all the dark past and make his future so bright
and full of joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding he had come to a house upon which
death had set its seal, and he could not help a feeling of
sorrow for the man so near the bounds of eternity, yet his
heart was bounding with a new and blessed hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>He no longer needed to school himself to calmly endure
the ordeal of meeting Editha; there was no need now to
force back with an iron will all the natural impulses of his
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not his sister, and he knew well now why his
whole soul had revolted against the fiendish lie with which
Sumner Dalton had sought to crush him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha would be his wife now; she would go back with
him to Wycliffe when they should be needed here no longer;
she would go there to reign as his honored and beautiful
mistress, and he would have the right to love her; there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>was no sin now in loving her as fondly as his great, true
heart prompted him to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>His face grew luminous as he sat there and waited for
her; his eyes lost their heavy look of forced endurance, and
softened into rare, sweet tenderness.</p>

      <div class='line'>“After the shower, the tranquil sun—</div>
      <div class='line'>Silver stars when the day is done.</div>

      <div class='line'>Joyful greetings from sad farewells.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Earle hummed this little verse, with a fond smile wreathing
his handsome lips, his glad heart beating time to its
hopeful rhythm, as he listened to catch the first sound of
the footfalls he so loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha Dalton—so called since the first year of her babyhood—was
indeed the child of Richard Forrester and Madam
Sylvester, or Mrs. Forrester, as she must henceforth be
called, and only a few words will be needed to give an outline
of his early life.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was quite young a maiden aunt had died, leaving
him heir to a handsome fortune. As soon as he had
completed his college course he made the acquaintance of
Estelle Sylvester.</p>

<p class='c007'>He loved her from the very first, and though he thought
her a trifle giddy and wild, he laid it to the fact that French
people are naturally vivacious and freer in their manners
than the staid, Puritanic Americans, and he reasoned that
when she should marry and assume the responsibilities of
domestic life, she would sober down into the quiet, self-possessed
matron.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a year after their marriage, as we have said, all went
well—indeed, the wild and giddy Estelle became too quiet
and sedate to suit him; but that he attributed to the state
of her health somewhat. But when, on the fatal morning
of Louis Villemain’s return, he learned the truth that his
wife had never loved him, but that her heart had been
wholly another’s even when she had vowed to love him
only until death, he was crushed for the moment; then his
fiery temper gained the ascendency, and, for the time, made
almost a madman of him, and he uttered words which in
his calmer moments he would never have spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon his return one evening, after a day of solitude and
of brooding over his injury, finding his wife and child gone,
he was for the instant tempted to put an end to his life,
but a wise hand stayed the rash act.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>All night long he mourned for the lost ones—for he had
loved his wife tenderly, and his baby had been his idol—with
a bitterness which only strong natures like his can experience;
but when morning broke, and he began to consider
the dishonor that would fall upon him, his passion flamed
anew, and when poor, penitent Estelle returned at noon, his
heart was like a wall of brass to her entreaties and prayers
for forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was sorry afterward, bitterly sorry, when he came to
reflect on his rashness, and that all her life-long his child
must be motherless; but the deed was done—he had driven
his wife away in disgrace, and he would not relent enough
to recall her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took his baby and her nurse, and sailed immediately
for the United States. His sister was about changing her
home to a distant city, and to her care he committed his
little Editha, to be brought up as her own, deeming it wiser
to renounce all claim to her than that she should grow
up to know of her mother’s folly and sin.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was what those strange words meant that he uttered
upon the night before he died, when his eyes fondly followed
Editha from the room, and he had said: “God grant
that <em>that</em> sin may never shadow <em>her</em> life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After the death of his parents he had left his native town
and repaired to the city where his sister, Mrs. Dalton, resided,
that he might be near and watch over his child, whom
he loved almost to idolatry.</p>

<p class='c007'>He never sought to obtain a divorce from Estelle, nor
cared to marry again; his trust in woman was destroyed,
and he lived only to make Editha happy, and amass a
fortune to leave her at his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>How well he succeeded in this we all know; her life up
to his death was like a cloudless summer’s day: she had
never known a care or a sorrow that he had not lightened;
she had never shed a tear in his presence that he had not
wiped with the utmost tenderness away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from what might be considered his unreasonableness
and harshness toward his young and erring wife, he
was a noble, tender-hearted, upright man, beloved and respected
to an unusual degree by all who knew him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His was a singularly sad and isolated life, brightened only
by the occasional presence of the child he dare not own, lest
he bring a blight on her otherwise sunny life.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he lived, Sumner Dalton had not dared to treat
her in any but the most gentle and tender manner. She
might oppose him in any way that her imperious little will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>dictated, but he could only hide his anger and irritability
by laughing at her wilfulness. But once Richard Forrester’s
surveillance removed, his natural tyranny and cruelty came
to the surface, causing her much of sadness and suffering,
while he even dared to risk her life and happiness to gratify
his ignoble passion for revenge upon another.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVII<br> <span class='large'>EDITHA’S GREETING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fifteen minutes after Madam Forrester left Earle a light
step sounded outside the door, a trembling hand turned the
silver handle, and Editha Forrester stood once more in the
presence of her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was somewhat pale and worn, as madam had said;
but a lovely flush of expectation and delight had crept into
her cheeks, and a joyous light gleamed from her beautiful
eyes, as Earle leaped to his feet and went forward to meet
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>No word was spoken for the first few moments—their
feelings were too deep, too sacred, for any outward expression;
but Earle drew her to his breast and held her there
with a strong, tender clasp that claimed her his own forever—that
told her they would nevermore be parted while
both should live.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha was the first to break the significant silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, I am <em>glad</em> you have come,” she said, as she raised
her eyes shining with happy tears to read the face she loved
so well.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the same simple yet hearty greeting that she had
given him so long ago on that day before Christmas, when
he had come to her. Earle remembered it, and drew her
still closer as he thought of her constancy to him through
all the various changes of the last four years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The wings of the wind were not rapid enough to bear
me to you, my own, when I knew that you wanted me;
and yet I did not dream of the joy that was awaiting me,”
he said, with tremulous gladness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joy and sorrow too, Earle, for papa cannot remain with
us long,” she answered, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>She still called Mr. Dalton by the old familiar name, for
not only would it have been awkward to change, but it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>would have seemed cruel to the invalid, who in all the
world had alone this fair girl to cling to.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in her heart she thanked God every day that Richard
Forrester had been her father instead of Sumner Dalton,
while no words could express her joy for the loving mother
she had found.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it pains me to find him as he is,” Earle returned,
in answer to her remark; but he was thinking more of his
spiritual condition than of his physical suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is very sorry for the past,” Editha said, with a wistful
look; “he talks of it almost constantly in his sleep in a
wild, sad way, although he speaks bitterly when he is awake.
He begs Marion—that was your mother, Earle—to forgive
him, and tells her that he did not see things then as he does
now. I think she would forgive him now if she could
see him; and, Earle, I wish you could forgive him, too.
Oh, if you could part at peace with each other!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can, my darling. I have never wished him any
ill, and freely forgive him every wrong; though, of course,
it cannot be expected that I could feel any affection for
him,” Earle replied, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—oh, no.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And my mother’s wrongs were very grievous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” Editha said, with a deep sigh of regret, as
she thought of that delicate, lovely girl, and what torture
she must have endured when she believed herself betrayed
and scorned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, can <em>you</em> forgive Mr. Dalton for all he has wilfully
made you suffer—for trying to part us when there was
no need, and for seeking to hide you from your mother?”
Earle asked, regarding her curiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tears sprang to her eyes as she answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes; he is dying, you know, and I could not let
him leave me feeling that I cherished any bitterness toward
him. His path to the grave is very dark, and I would not
add to its gloom. It has been very hard to bear all those
things,” she added, sighing; “but I think papa has been the
worst sufferer, after all. He never was unkind to me until
after my dear father died. Oh, Earle,” she cried, her
lovely face lighting up with tenderness, “you don’t know
how I love to think that he was my father—I loved him so
dearly. I used to think sometimes that I was really ungrateful
to love him so very much when he was only my
uncle; but now I know why it was—it was the natural
impulse of my heart going out to him, where it belonged.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>“How like a romance the story of your life is, my darling,”
Earle said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not more so than your own, I am quite sure, Earle.
But do you not think mother is very lovely?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is, truly. How very happy you are in the knowledge
of your parentage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and for more reasons than one,” she answered, with
a shy smile at him, accompanied with a rosy blush; then
she added, more gravely: “But I wish my mother need not
have suffered quite so deeply. If my father could but have
known how sorry and repentant she was, and how truly good
she was at heart, they might have grown to be very happy
after awhile; he need not have lived such a lonely, sorrowful
life, and all this sin and trouble need never have been.
But”—with a sigh of regret—“we have no right to question
the dealings of One who is wiser than we. There is some
good reason for all the suffering there is in the world, and
some one has somewhere said that ‘human lives are like
some sweet plants, which must be crushed ere they give
forth their sweetest fragrance.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we are told somewhere else that gold seven times
tried is pure. How very free from dross, then, you must
be, my darling,” Earle said, with playful tenderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed, Earle; my trials and sorrows have been
nothing compared to yours,” Editha said, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bitterness of the past disappears in the brightness
of the present, and what the future promises to be; and I
do not forget, my darling, that but for your fortitude a
dark shadow would still rest upon my life—you endured a
great deal for my sake, Editha,” and his lips touched her
forehead almost reverently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I would have resisted until I died rather than have
given up my treasure into the hands of that wicked man,”
she cried, with something of the old wilful gleam in her eyes.
“Do you know,” she added, eagerly, in the same breath,
“that I have found the Lokers, and they are now just as
comfortable as they can be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And all owing to your own kindness of heart and liberal
hand, no doubt,” Earle responded, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How could I help expressing my gratitude in some way
for having that dark mystery solved and every stigma removed
from your character? I did help them to begin
with, but they are going to help themselves now. I stocked
a cunning little store with fancy and useful articles, furnished
two rooms in the rear for their private use, and they
are really very successful in their little business.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>“With you for their chief patron, I presume,” was Earle’s
laughing reply, as he gazed admiringly into her animated
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, of course, I go there,” she admitted, flushing,
“to get all my needles, pins, thread, etc., and so do a great
many of my friends. But Mrs. Loker is really a very worthy
woman, and her daughter is bright and keen as a brier
at a trade; it is a real pleasure to encourage such people.
But I have talked enough about myself—tell me something
about your adventure with that wicked creature who has
brought so much trouble upon us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle complied, relating all that had occurred from the
night of the attempted robbery until the time of his departure,
while Editha listened intensely interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know I stand almost in awe of you to know
that you have accomplished such a change in that vile nature?
It seems almost like a miracle,” she said, when he
had finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not think of it, then, for I have no wish, I assure
you, to inspire you with any such sentiment toward me.
But I do not think this looks as if you were <em>very</em> much
afraid of me,” he laughed, as he gathered her closer in his
arms and kissed the fair face upon his breast again and
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be obliged to impose a duty upon all such operations
in the future if you carry them to such an extent,” she
said, trying to hide her blushing face with a very insufficient
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then never tell me again that you stand in awe of
me, or I shall feel it <em>my</em> duty to take even more effective
measures to eradicate the feeling,” Earle said, with mock
gravity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But about this man”—Editha thought it best to change
the subject—“don’t you think you’re carrying your kindness a
little too far? He may betray your trust; besides, he has violated
the laws of the land, and have you any right to shield
him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose I am not obliged to give any evidence against
him, since he was not arrested by a commissioned officer; the
offense was against myself alone, and if I see fit to take no
action in the matter, I do not see how I am violating any
right, either civil or moral—particularly as I am conscientiously
convinced that the man’s salvation depends upon
kindness rather than upon punishment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle had argued this matter many times with himself, and
he felt that he was doing perfectly right.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>“If suffering is any penalty for sin,” he continued, “he
has paid it, for he was fearfully wounded. I fully believe,
if he had escaped unharmed from the bullet, and been arrested,
convicted and sentenced, he would have grown more
hardened and desperate, and been prepared for almost any
evil upon the expiration of his term. But laid upon a bed
of sickness, with some one to care for him and treat him as
if he was a human being, he has had opportunity to think
as he has never thought before. As Mr. Dalton said to-day,
‘things look very different to a man when he fears that
life is slipping from his grasp than they do when he is in the
full vigor of life,’ and I think Tom Drake realized that, if
ever a man did. He was not easily won—he was suspicious
of me and my motives for a long time, but when he found
that I would take no measures against him he was completely
staggered; and the shock which his hitherto benumbed conscience
thus received restored it to something like its normal
condition. I believe he will do well, and, as long as he does,
I shall give him my support and confidence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But didn’t you feel the least bit triumphant when he
lay there powerless before you?” Editha asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot say that I did not experience a sense of satisfaction
in knowing that at last one so deserving of justice
and so steeped in crime had been arrested in his career.
But my first thought was, ‘Are my hands stained with the
life-blood of a fellow-being?’ It was a great relief when I
discovered that he was not mortally wounded, but my anxiety
returned when he was so sick and we thought he would die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a great care for you, Earle, and a noble thing
for you to do after suffering all you have on his account,”
Editha said, her heart swelling with pride of her noble
lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know the more care any one occasions us the more
interest we naturally feel in that one,” he answered, smiling
at her praise; “and so it was in this case. I saw the man
was capable of better things; he is naturally smart, and I
longed to save him despite the injury he had done me and
others. If there was one thing harder than all the rest
for me to forgive, it was his treatment of you. Will it be
agreeable to you, dearest, to see him about the place when
we go home?” he asked, seeing the shiver which crept involuntarily
over her at the mention of the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha flushed involuntarily at the mention of going
“home,” but she said, with gentle gravity:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Earle; if we can save him, I can conquer the repugnance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>that I have hitherto felt for him; but, as I remember
him, he seems perfectly hideous to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He does not look nearly so repulsive since his sickness;
he is, of course, much thinner and more refined in
appearance, while his expression is wholly changed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether he is changed or not, I will join you heart
and hand in any good thing you may wish to do for him,”
she said, heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a gentle mistress Wycliffe will have,” Earle said,
fondly; “and you will not refuse to go back with me this
time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Earle; only it must not be at present, you know,”
she returned, with some sadness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do know, dear, and of course shall remain as long
as Mr. Dalton may need either you or me; but, oh! my
darling, you cannot tell how thankful I am that I am not
doomed to spend my life in gloom and alone; everything
has looked so dreary and desolate to me until to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha did not reply, but she laid her cheek against his
in mute sympathy, and with a sigh that told him she had
also experienced something of the desolateness of which he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have not seen Mr. Tressalia yet, I suppose?” she
said, after a few minutes of silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, dear, I have not seen him since the day I had such
a struggle with my selfishness, and sent him hither to win
you and be happy if he could.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His arm tightened around the slight form at his side as
he said this, and Editha knew how he must have suffered
in that struggle to renounce her so utterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did <em>you</em> send him to me, Earle?” she asked, with a
startled look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, dear; Paul Tressalia is one of earth’s noblest men.
I believed you lost to me forever. You once told me if there
had been no Earle Wayne in the world, you might have loved
him. I wanted you to be happy—I wanted him to know
something of the comfort of life, and I knew of no one
whom I would rather have win a sister of mine than him. It
was a miserable kind of an arrangement all round, but
I knew of nothing better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle spoke with a tinge of the bitterness he had experienced
at the time, as if even the memory of it was exceedingly
painful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Earle, you might have known it could not be,” she
whispered, sliding one hand into his and dropping her flushed
face upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>“Never—not even if our relations had remained as we
have believed them to be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never,” she replied, decidedly. “I <em>could</em> not change, even
though I believed I was sinning every day of my life, and
I would not wrong him by accepting his love when I had
none to give him in return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Editha, my beloved, I should crown you with passionflowers
and snow-drops for your devotion and faithfulness,”
Earle breathed, in low, intense tones, and deeply moved by
her confession.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush!” she said, releasing herself from his encircling
arms, her face like a carnation; “there is the bell—that is
Mr. Tressalia; he has heard of the arrival of a steamer,
and has come to see if you are here;” and she arose to go,
feeling that she could not be present while they met.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle arose, too, surmising her thought, but gently detained
her a moment longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My love—my Editha—my ‘<em>happiness</em>,’ you have not yet
told me that you are glad to be my wife, and go home with
me to Wycliffe; let me hear you say it once,” he pleaded,
with grave earnestness, as he studied the beautiful face intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know that I am glad, Earle;” and the clear, truthful
eyes were raised to his with a look that satisfied him,
though the conscious crimson dyed all her fair face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And there will be no regret at leaving your native land?”
he persisted, his whole being thrilling with the consciousness
of her pure love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not one, save the lonely graves I shall leave behind
and would like to visit occasionally,” she murmured, with
a starting tear, as she thought of Richard Forrester and his
sister sleeping so quietly side by side in Greenwood, and
of that other grave that must soon be made beside them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle lifted the sweet face and kissed the tremulous lips
with infinite tenderness, then releasing her, she slipped from
the room by one door as Paul Tressalia entered by another.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greeting of the two young men was cordial and
friendly, although each felt a thrill of pain as they clasped
hands and realized all that that meeting meant to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each knew that as soon as Mr. Dalton should be laid away
Earle would claim Editha as his wife, and take her back
to reign in the home of his ancestors, where, doubtless,
a life of joy, such as falls to the lot of few, would be spent.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Paul Tressalia was not a man to sit weakly down
and pine for what he could not have.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since that day when he had pleaded his suit for the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>time with Editha, and she had in her despair cried out for
a friend, strong and true, he had bravely set himself to
work to conquer the hopeless passion in his heart, and he
had already learned to look upon his future with a calmness
at which he himself at times was surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came to-day as both Earle’s and Editha’s tried and
trusted friend, and the congratulations which he tendered
the former had a ring of heartiness in them not to be questioned
for a moment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVIII<br> <span class='large'>EARLE’S BEAUTIFUL THEORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sumner Dalton lingered only a little more than a week
after Earle’s arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with his mind relieved of the burden of revenge so
long cherished, and of the secret which had threatened to
ruin Editha’s life—with his hate confessed, and his evil passions
burned out—he grew quieter and more at ease, even
though he knew that he must enter the dark valley very
soon.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had talked with Earle once again regarding the past,
seeming anxious to know something of Marion’s last days,
and appeared much agitated when, with as little reflection
upon him as possible, he gave a short account of her sorrowful,
secluded life, and her calm resignation in the hour
of death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle knew that he longed to be assured of his forgiveness
for the bitter wrongs of which he had been guilty, and
yet deemed it a mockery to crave it; but he knew that it
would comfort him inexpressibly, and he told him one day
that he accorded it fully and freely, and begged him to seek
pardon also from a higher source.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether he did or not they never knew, for he avoided
referring to anything that bore upon the past from that
time; but he grew comparatively peaceful, and they hoped
that he had obtained mercy from the divine Healer of souls.</p>

<p class='c007'>He seemed more content when Earle was in his room,
and lay and watched him by the hour, a wistful look in his
sunken eyes, as if all too late he realized what a crown
to his life such a son would have been.</p>

<p class='c007'>Together Earle and Editha watched beside him, until the
flame of life burned down to its socket and then went out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>and with it every spark of feeling (save that of regret
for a life that seemed to have been so spent in vain) expired
from their hearts also.</p>

<p class='c007'>They laid him beside his wife, and placed above him a
costly marble shaft, simply inscribed with his name, age,
and the date of his death. What more could they do?</p>

<p class='c007'>Unloving and unloved he had lived, unlamented he had
died, without one grand or noble act to crown his life or
to be remembered when he was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a record! and sad enough for tears “such as angels
weep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha and her mother went together to Richard Forrester’s
grave—Editha with a strange, sad yearning for the
father she had never known as such while he lived, and
madam with a heart filled with deep regret for the past,
and for the noble life she had so saddened by one rash act.</p>

<p class='c007'>But each felt, as they turned away from the sacred spot,
that could he have spoken, he would have blessed them
both, and rejoiced with them in their new-found joy and
reunion.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>Three weeks later there was a quiet wedding one morning
in the fine old church where Editha had been wont to
attend since her earliest remembrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding that Editha had desired everything done
with as little ostentation as possible, on account of their
recent bereavement, yet the church had been elegantly decorated
by her numerous friends, many of whom were present,
with no small degree of curiosity, to witness the ceremony
that made her the Marchioness of Wycliffe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wedding breakfast was a very informal affair, to
which only her most intimate friends had been bidden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course Mr. Felton, the trusty lawyer, was among
these, and with him a quiet, matronly woman, whom he
had found thus late in life to share the remainder of his
journey; and into his hands Editha’s beautiful home was
to pass upon her departure for England.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Loker’s wife and daughter, both neatly and tastefully
clad, were also among the favored guests; and, looking
into their cheerful countenances, one would scarce have
recognized the wretched beings whom Editha had visited
on that memorable night two years previous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fair bride’s wedding robes were of heavy white crape,
with satin facings, while the mist-like vail which floated
from her golden hair was fastened with fragrant lilies of the
valley and delicate, feathery cypress vine.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>“So appropriate under the circumstances,” murmured the
admiring friends who had gathered to do honor to the
occasion; and indeed the fair-haired, blue-eyed girl had
never looked more lovely than when she stood at the altar
in her pure white raiment, and plighted her vows to the
one to whom she had been so true through the dark hours
of adversity as well as in prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had loved him while yet a poor boy serving in her
father’s office; she had loved and bravely defended him
when he stood before the judge and was unjustly condemned,
and during the three weary years that followed; and the
depth of that love she testified when she almost sacrificed
her life to preserve his character from dishonor. Not less
did she love him now, as he stood by her side, grand noble,
and honored by all, as the Marquis of Wycliffe and Viscount
Wayne, and possessor of a proud inheritance—an old and
honored name.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she would have loved him just as fondly, she would
have wedded him just as proudly, had he been simple Earle
Wayne, without a dollar in his pocket or a foot of land,
save what his own strong right arm had won for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the noble spirit, the stainless character, the firm,
unwavering rectitude and honor that had won her heart’s
devotion; and yet his position and wealth were not valueless
in her sight; they were accessories by which they would
be enabled to make more perfect and useful the life which
God had given them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I live I mean to make my life foursquare,” he had
said, with quiet determination, when he had come to her
from his weary prison life; and she had never forgotten
the resolute words—they had rung in her ears ever since
like a watch-word. And to-day, as she stood at his side
and spoke those solemn vows, she thought of them again,
and she prayed that together they might live a life so perfect
and complete that it should be like that “golden city
whose length, and breath, and height were equal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So exceedingly romantic. Who would have thought it?”
was the comment of not a few who had been rehearsing
the incidents of the past six or seven years, but were interrupted
as the distinguished bridal party passed up the broad
aisle to the altar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gustave Sylvester was to give away the bride, while
Madam Forrester, very handsome, in mauve-colored moire,
Spanish lace, and diamonds, came in on the arm of Paul
Tressalia, who was by no means the least distinguished-looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>one of the party, though his face might have been
thought much too pale and stern for a wedding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle met them at the altar, very quiet and self-possessed,
but with a luminous light in his eyes that told of the
depth of the joy in his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the wedding breakfast this party of five bade a
long farewell to their guests and friends, and departed for
the steamer that was to bear them to their beautiful home
on England’s shores.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>Three years have passed, and we will take just one peep
at the domestic life at Wycliffe before we, too, part with
them for all time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great mansion, the pride of all the country around,
with its wide wings on either side, stands on a slight eminence,
and is grand and imposing in appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was built in the Tudor style of architecture, with massive
carvings and ornamentations, and was a home of which
any man, however great, might have been proud.</p>

<p class='c007'>An extensive lawn spread out in front, and was decorated
here and there with patches and borders of landscape
gardening, beautiful shrubbery, fountains, and statuary,
while beyond and to the right of this was the park, with
its noble trees, its deer and game.</p>

<p class='c007'>Magnificent beeches, elms, and maples spread their lofty,
protecting arms above and around the mansion, lending a
delightful shade, and making a pleasing contrast with the
brown-stone of the dwelling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beneath one of these trees there might have been seen,
on a certain summer’s day, an exceedingly attractive group,
and, to all appearances, a very happy one also.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon a graceful rustic seat there are sitting two beautiful
women.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha, fair and lovely as of old, no cloud to dim the
blue of her sunny eyes, no care or trouble having left a line
on her white brow. She is a trifle more matronly in her
appearance, has a bit more of dignity, perhaps, but is otherwise
unchanged. Her companion is a lady of perhaps thirty-two
or three years, whose face impresses one at once with
its expression of sweetness and gentleness. It is a face that
we have seen before, and that once seen could never be
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady is none other than the one we have known as
Miss Isabelle Grafton, the daughter of Bishop Grafton,
that good old man who married Earle’s mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Standing behind her, his eyes resting with peculiar fondness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>upon her face, is a noble-appearing man. It is Paul
Tressalia, her husband of a few months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam’s prophecy had come true, and he had at last
found the “woman whom he should marry,” and they are
as quietly, calmly happy as they could ever hope to be in
this world, neither feeling, perhaps, the fervor of a first
passion, but loving earnestly and with an enduring affection
that would grow riper with every year.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was this gentle woman’s face that had come, unbidden,
to Paul Tressalia’s mind on that day when madam
had told him that he would yet find one good and true
who would fill the wants of his nature better than Editha
could ever do.</p>

<p class='c007'>A year after his return to England they had met again;
each had attracted the other, and out of it had grown the
union, which bade fair to be a most happy one.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Editha’s feet there is playing a dark-eyed, noble-looking
boy of two years—little Paul, the future Marquis of Wycliffe;
while an old lady, of perhaps sixty, sits at a respectful
distance and watches with her heart in her eyes his every
movement, lest he should annoy “my lady” with his play and
his constant prattle. This latter is Tom Drake’s mother.
A short distance away there paces back and forth under
the trees a white-aproned, white-capped nurse, with a fair-haired,
blue-eyed little girl in her arms—the “small Lady
Isabelle” she is called, being as yet only three months old,
and of very tiny though perfect proportions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only remaining one of this group—Madam Forrester—reclines
in a chair a little in the background. She is as
handsome and attractive as ever, with a tranquil joy in her
face that bespeaks very little to wish for even in this world.
Her white shapely hands are busied with some dainty piece
of work destined to grace the “small ladyship,” who is her
particular pride and comfort, while every now and then she
joins in the conversation carried on chiefly by Editha and
Paul Tressalia and his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Down the broad drive-way at some distance, and approaching
slowly, are two men.</p>

<p class='c007'>One glance is sufficient to tell us which is Earle—there is
no mistaking his grand proportions, his upright form, with
its noble head setting square and firm and with manly dignity
upon his broad shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>He is evidently giving some directions to his companion,
for they stop every now and then while Earle points here and
there, and then resumes his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they draw nearer the group under the beech, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>noticeable that his companion is slightly lame, and as they
reach the spot he lifts his hat respectfully to Editha, smiles
fondly into the eyes of the old lady who is watching Earle’s
boy, and then passes on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is none other than Tom Drake, once the midnight
robber and abductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Earle’s return he was able to be about once more,
and had made himself acquainted with much pertaining
to the estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had worked diligently and with great interest over the
accounts Earle had left him, and unheeding the admonitions
of his mother, who had arrived a few days after his departure,
he refused to leave them until every figure was
straightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had taken it upon himself to superintend the decorations
of the mansion and grounds, when Earle had telegraphed
on what day he should arrive at Wycliffe with his
bride, and a scene of almost bewildering beauty greeted
their home-coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was made a day of general rejoicing, the tenantry, servants,
and laborers all turning out in gala attire to give
them a glorious reception and welcome to Wycliffe.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Tom Drake had remained in the background while
all others went forward to tender their good wishes and congratulations,
and it was not until Earle asked particularly
for him that he ventured to present himself before those
two, whose lives he had done so much to render miserable.
Then he came modestly forward, bearing a magnificent
bouquet and wreath in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The former composed entirely of box, white bell-flowers,
and blue violets, and embodying the sentiments, constancy,
gratitude, and faithfulness, he placed in Earle’s hand, wishing
him “long life and happiness.” The wreath, a marvel
of delicate beauty, was made of the finest leaves of yew
tree and graceful clusters of pure white wisteria, the leaves
signifying sorrow for the past, the flowers “Welcome, fair
stranger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This Tom Drake laid at the feet of Editha, with a few
murmured words of greeting, made a low obeisance, and
then went away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Earle and his wife were surprised at this manifestation
of feeling, and the delicate manner in which it was
expressed; and they prized these simple offerings as highly
as any of the rich gifts that they had received from their
numerous wealthy friends, on account of the emotions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>had prompted them and which they had been quick to
read and appreciate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle was so pleased with his work upon the tangled accounts,
and the interest he manifested in things generally,
that he allowed him in the future to assist the steward, who
was quite old, and, upon the death of that individual, which
occurred about two years after their return, Tom was so
well versed in all his duties, and had proved himself so
faithful and trustworthy, that he elected him as his successor.
He had lost very much of the ruffian-like appearance that
had made him so repulsive to Editha, and was now very quiet
and unostentatious in his manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unsightly scar, of course, still remained upon his
face, but his expression told of a firm resolve to conquer
himself and become the man that Earle desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was lame in the limb that had been wounded, and
probably always would be, but Earle never looks at him
without a thrill of thankfulness that he was impressed to
pursue the course that he has with him, and believes him
to be a lasting monument to the power of kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom and his mother live in a pretty cottage, covered
with climbing woodbine and clematis, and situated only a
short distance from the mansion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both mother and son idolize my lady, who is kind and
gracious to them, and old Mrs. Drake is often seen, as to-day,
caring for Earle’s noble boy, “the like of which,” she
fondly declares, “was never born before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editha arose as Earle approached, the smile upon her
lips and the tender light in her eyes bespeaking the glad
welcome in her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are late, dear,” she said, slipping her white hand
within his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little; but you have plenty of pleasant company,” Earle
replied, with a smile, as his eyes wandered over the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>The look that the fair wife flashed up at him from her
lovely eyes plainly told him that no company, however pleasant,
was quite like his—no group complete to her without
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Earle stooped and picked up his boy, which had toddled
to his side, and gave him a toss on high that made the
little fellow clap his hands with delight, and the air rang
with his happy, childish laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Earle, I have been trying to explain to Isabelle your
theory of the golden city,” said Editha, when Master Paul
had become quiet once more; “but I’ve only made a bungle
of it, and you will have to interpret yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>“I presume Mrs. Tressalia would not agree with me in
my ideas regarding the revelation,” Earle said, with a smile,
as he turned to that lady. “There is so much that seems
visionary and mystical in it, that none of us can fully understand
or explain it, but <em>whatever</em> lessons we may draw from
it can do us no harm. As for the ‘city which lieth foursquare,
whose length, breadth, and height are equal,’ it seems
to <em>me</em> more like the symbol of a perfected life than like the
description of a literal city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had never thought of it in that light before,” Mrs.
Tressalia said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we make the height and breath of our life equal with
its length, it cannot fail to be perfect and of faultless symmetry,
can it?” asked the young marquis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What constitutes the height and breadth of a life as you
express it?” Mrs. Tressalia queried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The height,” Earle replied, his eyes resting earnestly
on the far-off purple and crimson clouds of the western
sky, as if beyond them he could almost distinguish that
golden symbol of which he was speaking—“the height is
attained only by a continued reaching upward of the finite
for the infinite; the breadth, by the constant practice of
that divine charity or love and self-denial as taught by the
Man of Sorrows while He dwelt on earth—at least, this is
my idea of it. This aspiration after holiness, this daily
practice of the divine commands, if followed as long as
one lives, cannot fail to make his being one of faultless
symmetry in the end, and fit to be measured by the ‘golden
reed of the angel.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yours is a beautiful theory,” Mrs. Tressalia said, a mist
gathering in her soft eyes; “and yet, after all, I do not
feel that I can quite agree with you. I have always believed
that chapter of revelation describes the heavenly
city in which we are to dwell when we leave this earth. It
is a more tangible idea to me, and I think I like it better
than your theory on that account.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You believe in the literal city, pure and holy; I in a
state or existence of a like nature. Whichever is the correct
belief, it cannot fail of attaining one and the same
result—eternal happiness,” Earle said, with his rare smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is true; but if you do not believe in the literal
city, what do you make the foundations, ‘garnished with
precious stones,’ to mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Tressalia was deeply interested in his ideas, even if
she did not fully agree with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fear if I should try to explain all my theory regarding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>it, it would involve us in an endless discussion,” Earle
said. “The garnishing of precious stones <em>may</em> mean the
cultivation of those many virtues spoken of by the apostle
Paul—such as love, peace, long suffering, gentleness, etc.
Surely those are precious jewels that every one would like
to possess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sonny boy, if <em>you</em> square <em>your</em> life by your father’s
rule, you’ll not lack for symmetry in the sight of God when
you come into the ‘golden city,’” muttered Tom Drake’s
mother, with fast-dropping tears, as she bent fondly over
little Paul, whom she had taken from his father’s arms.
Earle smiled good-naturedly as he caught the low-spoken
words, for he knew that in the grateful old creature’s eyes
he lacked no good thing in all the catalogue of virtues.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is so,” said Paul Tressalia, who had also heard
her; “and whether Earle’s theory is the correct one or not,
it can never harm one to put it in practice, particularly if
it attains to that nobility which has become so rooted and
grounded in his character,” and the look of affectionate admiration
which he bestowed upon his kinsman testified to the
heartiness of his words.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot follow them further, but we have learned
enough to tell us something of the principles of goodness
and purity which dwelt in that charming household, and
which could not fail to ennoble and elevate all by whom they
were surrounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who, like Earle Wayne, would not like to make his life
foursquare? Who, although he may never attain to the
worldly greatness which fell to his life, would not seek to
attain that better nobility of character, which, when measured
by the “golden reed of the angel,” will be found of
faultless symmetry, like the city whose “length, and breadth,
and height are equal?”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
